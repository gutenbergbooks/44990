<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE TORPEDO.&mdash;REMARKS ON THE
EXISTING STATE OF TORPEDO WARFARE.</small></h2>


<div class='hang2'>THE earliest record we have of the employment of an infernal
machine at all resembling the torpedo of the present day, was in
1585 at the siege of Antwerp. Here by means of certain small vessels,
drifted down the stream, in each of which was placed a magazine of
gunpowder, to be fired either by a trigger, or a combination of levers
and clockwork, an Italian engineer, Lambelli, succeeded in demolishing
a bridge that the enemy had formed over the Scheldt.</div>

<p>So successful was this first attempt, and so tremendous was the
effect produced on the spectators, by the explosion of one of these
torpedoes, that further investigation of this new mode of Naval warfare
was at once instituted.</p>

<p>But it was not until some two hundred years after that any real
progress was effected, though numerous attempts were made during
this period, to destroy vessels by means of sub-marine infernal
machines.</p>

<p>It was owing to the fact, that the condition which is now
considered as essential in torpedo warfare, viz., that the charge
must be submerged, was then entirely ignored, that so long a
standstill occurred in this new art of making war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Captain Bushnell, the Inventor of Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;To Captain David
Bushnell, of Connecticut, in 1775, is most certainly due the credit of
inventing torpedoes, or as he termed them submarine magazines.
For he first proved practically that a charge of gunpowder could be
fired under water, which is incontestably the essence of submarine
warfare.</p>

<p><i>Submarine Boat.</i>&mdash;To Captain Bushnell is also due the credit
of first devizing a submarine boat for the purpose of conveying his
magazines to the bottom of hostile ships and there exploding them.</p>

<p><i>Drifting Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;Another plan of his for destroying vessels,
was that of connecting two of his infernal machines together by means
of a line, and throwing them into the water, allowing the current to
carry them across the bows of the attacked ship.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Ignition.</i>&mdash;The ignition of his magazines was generally
effected by means of clockwork, which, when set in motion, would
run for some time before exploding the machines, thus enabling the
operators to get clear of the explosion.</p>

<p>Captain Bushnell's few attempts to destroy our ships off the
American coast in 1776 and 1777, with his submarine boat, and his
drifting torpedoes were all attended with failure, a result generally
experienced, where new inventions are for the first time subjected to
the test of actual service.</p>

<p><i>Robert Fulton.</i>&mdash;Robert Fulton, an American, following in his
footsteps, some twenty years after, revived the subject of submarine
warfare, which during that interval seems to have been entirely
forgotten.</p>

<p>A resident in France, in 1797, he is found during that year making
various experiments on the Seine with a machine which he had
constructed, and by which he designed "to impart to carcasses of
gunpowder a progressive motion under water, to a certain point, and
there explode them."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p><i>Fulton's Failures.</i>&mdash;Though these first essays of his resulted in
failure, Fulton thoroughly believed in the efficacy of his schemes, and
we find him, during that and succeeding years, vainly importunating
the French and Dutch Governments, to grant him aid and support in
carrying out experiments with his new inventions, whereby he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
perfect them, and thus ensure to whichever government acceded to his
views, the total destruction of their enemy's fleets.</p>

<p><i>Bonaparte aids Fulton.</i>&mdash;Though holding out such favourable
terms, it was not until 1800, when Bonaparte became First Consul,
that Fulton's solicitations were successful, and that money was granted
him to carry out a series of experiments.</p>

<p>In the following year (1801), under Bonaparte's immediate patronage,
Fulton carried out various and numerous experiments in the harbour
of Brest, principally with a submarine boat devised by him (named
the <i>Nautilus</i>), subsequently to his invention of submarine carcasses
as a means of approaching a ship and fixing one of his infernal
machines beneath her, unbeknown to the crew of the attacked ship.</p>

<p><i>First Vessel destroyed by Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;In August, 1801, Fulton
completely destroyed a small vessel in Brest harbour by means of one
of his submarine bombs, then called by him for the first time, torpedoes,
containing some twenty pounds of gunpowder. This is the first
vessel known to have been sunk by a submarine mine.</p>

<p><i>Bonaparte's patronage withdrawn.</i>&mdash;Notwithstanding the apparent
success, and enormous power of Fulton's projects, on account of
a failure on his part to destroy one of the English Channel fleet, at the
end of 1801, Bonaparte at once withdrew his support and aid.</p>

<p>Disgusted with this treatment, and having been previously pressed
by some of England's most influential men, to bring his projects to
that country, so that the English might reap the benefit of his
wonderful schemes, Fulton left France, and arrived in London, in May,
1804.</p>

<p><i>Pitt supports Fulton.</i>&mdash;Mr. Pitt, then Prime Minister, was much
struck with Fulton's various schemes of submarine warfare, and after
examining one of his infernal machines, or torpedoes, exclaimed,
"that if introduced into practice, it could not fail to annihilate all
military marines."<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>Though having secured the approval of Mr. Pitt, and a few other
members of the Government, he was quite unable to induce the
English to accept his schemes in toto, and at once employ them in the
Naval service.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>Twice Fulton attempted to destroy French men-of-war, lying in
the harbour of Boulogne, by means of his drifting torpedoes, but each
time he failed, owing as he then explained, and which afterwards proved
to be the case, to the simple mistake of having made his machines
specifically heavier than water, thus preventing the current from
carrying them under a vessel's bottom.</p>

<p><i>Destruction of the "Dorothea."</i>&mdash;Though in each of the above-mentioned
attempts Fulton succeeded in exploding his machines, and
though on the 15th October, 1805, in the presence of a numerous
company of Naval and other scientific men, he completely demolished
a stout brig, the <i>Dorothea</i>, off Walmer Castle, by means of his drifting
torpedoes, similar to those employed by him at Boulogne, but considerably
improved, still the English Government refused to have
anything further to do with him or his schemes.</p>

<p>England, at that time, being mistress of the seas, it was clearly
her interest to make the world believe that Fulton's schemes were
impracticable and absurd.</p>

<p>Earl St. Vincent, in a conversation with Fulton, told him in very
strong language, "that Pitt was a fool for encouraging a mode of
warfare, which, if successful, would wrest the trident from those who
then claimed to bear it, as the sceptre of supremacy on the ocean."<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>Wearied with incessant applications and neglect, and with failures,
not with his inventions, but in inducing governments to accept them,
he left England in 1806, and returned to his native country.</p>

<p><i>Application to Congress for Help.</i>&mdash;Arrived there, he lost no time
in solicitating aid from Congress to enable him to carry out experiments
with his torpedoes and submarine boats, practice alone in his
opinion being necessary to develop the extraordinary powers of his
invention, as an auxiliary to harbour defence.</p>

<p>By incessant applications to his government, and by circulating his
torpedo book<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> among the members, in which he had given detailed
accounts of all his previous experiments in France and England, and
elaborate plans for rendering American harbours, etc., invulnerable to
British attack, a Commission was appointed to inquire into and practically
test the value of these schemes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>They were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;<i>Drifting Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;Two torpedoes connected by a line
floated in the tide at a certain depth, and suffered to drift
across the bows of the vessel to be attacked; the coupling
line being arrested by the ship's cable would cause the
torpedoes to be forced under her bottom; this plan is
represented and will be readily understood by <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;<i>Harpoon Torpedo.</i>&mdash;A torpedo attached to one end of a
line, the other part to a harpoon, which was to be fired
into the bows of the doomed vessel from a piece of
ordnance mounted in the bows of a boat, specially constructed
for the purpose; the line being fixed to the
vessel by the harpoon, the current, if the vessel were
at anchor, or her progress if underweigh, would carry the
torpedo under her bottom. <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a> represents this type
of Fulton's submarine infernal machine.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;<i>Spar Torpedo.</i>&mdash;A torpedo attached to a spar suspended
by a swivel from the bowsprit of a torpedo boat, so
nearly balanced, that a man could easily depress, or
elevate the torpedo with one hand, whilst with the other
he pulled a trigger and exploded it.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;<i>Block Ship.</i>&mdash;Block ships, that is vessels from 50 to 100
tons, constructed with sides impervious to cannon shot,
and decks made impenetrable to musket shot. A spar
torpedo <i>a, a, a</i>, to be carried on each bow and quarter
<a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a> represents this curious craft.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>Stationary Mines.</i>&mdash;Stationary buoyant torpedoes for harbour
defence, to be fired by means of levers attached to triggers.
This kind of mine is shown at <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>.</div>

<div class='hang2'>5.&mdash;<i>Cable Cutters.</i>&mdash;Cable cutters, that is submarine guns discharging
a sharp piece of iron in the shape of a crescent,
with sufficient force to cut through ship's cables, or other
obstructions.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></div>

<p><i>Practical Experiments.</i>&mdash;Various and exhaustive experiments were
carried out in the presence of the Commissioners, tending generally to
impress them with a favourable view of Fulton's many projects.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p>As a final test, the sloop <i>Argus</i> was ordered, under the superintendence
of Commodore Rodgers, to whom Fulton had previously explained
his mode of attack, to be prepared to repel all attempts made
against her by Fulton, with his torpedoes.</p>

<p><i>Defence of the "Argus."</i>&mdash;Though repeated attempts were made,
none were successful, owing to the energetic, though somewhat exaggerated
manner in which the defence of the sloop had been carried out.
She was surrounded by numerous spars lashed together, nets down to
the ground, grappling irons, heavy pieces of metal suspended from the
yard arms ready to be dropped into any boat that came beneath them,
scythes fitted to long spars for the purpose of mowing off the heads of
any who might be rash enough to get within range of them.</p>

<p>As Robert Fulton very justly remarked, "a system, then only in its
infancy, which compelled a hostile vessel to guard herself by such
extraordinary means could not fail of becoming a most important mode
of warfare."</p>

<p>Three of the Commissioners reported as favourably as could be
expected, considering its infancy, on the practical value of Fulton's
scheme of torpedo warfare.</p>

<p><i>Congress refuse aid.</i>&mdash;But on the strength of Commodore Rodgers's
report, which was as unfair and prejudiced, as the others were fair and
unprejudiced, Congress refused Fulton any further aid, or to countenance
any further experiments that he might still feel inclined to
prosecute.</p>

<p>Though undeterred by this fresh instance of neglect, and still
having a firm belief in the efficacy of his various torpedo projects, yet
other important matters connected with the improvement of the steam
engine occupied his whole time and prevented him from making any
further experiments with his submarine inventions.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Firing, 1829.</i>&mdash;Up to 1829, that is to say for nearly sixty
years after the invention of torpedoes, mechanical means only were
employed to effect the ignition of the torpedo charges, such as levers,
clockwork, and triggers pulled by hand; with such crude means of
exploding them, it is not extraordinary to find, that all the attempts
made to destroy hostile ships, resulted in failure.</p>

</div>

<p>Briefly reviewing the history of the torpedo during its first period
of existence, viz., from Captain Bushnell's invention of submarine
magazines in 1775, down to the introduction of electricity, as a means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of exploding submarine mines, by Colonel Colt, in 1829, we find that
due to the unwearied exertions, and numerous experiments carried out
by Captain Bushnell, Mr. R. Fulton and others, the following very
important principles in the art of torpedo warfare were fully proved:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;That a charge of gunpowder could be exploded under water.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;That any vessel could be sunk by a torpedo, provided only
the charge were large enough.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;That it was possible to construct a boat which could be
navigated, and remain for several hours under water,
without detriment to her crew.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;That a ship at anchor could be destroyed, by means of drifting torpedoes, or
by a submarine or ordinary boat, armed with a spar
torpedo.</div>

<div class='hang2'>5.&mdash;That a vessel underweigh could be destroyed by means
of stationary submarine mines, and by the harpoon
torpedo.</div>

<p>These principles, which at the time were fully admitted, laid the
foundations of the systems of torpedo warfare, that are at the present
day in vogue, all over the world.</p>

<p><i>Second Epoch.</i>&mdash;The second epoch in the life of the torpedo dates
from 1829, when Colonel Colt, then a mere lad, commenced experiments
with his submarine battery.</p>

<p><i>Colt's Experiments.</i>&mdash;His first public essay, was on the 4th June,
1842, when he exploded a case of powder in New York harbour, while
himself standing at a great distance off.</p>

<p>Having by numerous successful experiments satisfactorily proved
that vessels at anchor could be sunk by means of his electrical mines,
Colonel Colt engaged to destroy a vessel underweigh by similar means,
which feat he successfully accomplished on 13th April, 1844.</p>

<p><i>Colt's Electric Cable.</i>&mdash;The electric cable as used by Colonel Colt,
was insulated by cotton yarn, soaked in a solution of asphaltum and
beeswax, and the whole enclosed in a metal case.</p>

<p><i>Colt's Reflector.</i>&mdash;On examining Colt's papers after his death,
one was found illustrating one of his many devices for effecting the
explosion of a submarine mine at the proper instant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Description of Reflector.</i>&mdash;One set of conducting wires from all the
mines is permanently attached to a single pole of a very powerful
firing battery, the other wires lead to metal points which are
attached to marks on a chart of the channel in front of the operator
and which marks correspond with the actual positions of the
mines in the channel. A reflector, is arranged to throw the image
of a hostile vessel on the chart, and as this image passes over either
of the wire terminations on it, the operator with the other battery
wire, completes the circuit, and explodes the torpedo, over which
by her image thrown on the chart, the vessel is supposed to be
at that precise moment.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> In his experiment with a vessel under
weigh, Colt had probably taken the precaution of laying down several
circles of mines, and thus aided by cross staffs, ensured the experiment
being a success.</p>

<p>With regard to the invention of the word torpedo, for submarine
infernal machines, Dr. Barnard in his life of Colt says, "that Fulton
used the word torpedo, probably on account of its power of stunning
or making torpid, and that a long way through the water,&mdash;in so
naming it, he buildeth better than he knew, for Colt's torpedoes being
fired by electricity may with special fitness take its name from the
electric eel."<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p><i>Theoretical Knowledge.</i>&mdash;Though many opportunities have occurred
during the last thirty-five years for practically testing the effectiveness
of torpedoes when employed on actual service, especially during the
American Civil War (1861-65) and the late Turco-Russian War (1877-78),
yet in so far as the offensive and electrical portion of submarine
warfare is concerned, our knowledge of them is still principally
theoretically.</p>

<p><i>Failure of Offensive Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;The manipulation of the ordinary
spar or outrigger torpedo boats, and of the various automatic torpedoes,
appears simple enough, when practice is made with those submarine
weapons during peace time, also the results of such practice is without
doubt uniformly successful, yet when the crucial test of actual service
is applied, as was the case during the war of 1877, with the Whitehead
and spar torpedoes, then a succession of failures had to be recorded.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>The cause of this want of success in war-time with offensive
torpedoes, lies in the fact, that during peace time the experiments and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
practice carried out with them, are done so, under the most favourable
circumstances, that is to say in daylight, and the nerves of the
operators not in that high state of tension, which would be the case,
were they attacking a man-of-war on a pitch dark night, whose
exact position cannot be known, and from whose guns at any moment
a sheet of fire may be belched forth, and a storm of shot and bullets
be poured on them, whilst on actual service, this would in nine out of
ten instances be the case.</p>

<p>Some uncertainty must and will always exist in offensive torpedo
operations when carried out in actual war, where, as in this case, the
success of the enterprise depends almost wholly on the state of a
man's nerves, yet this defect, a want of certainty, may to a considerable
extent be eradicated were means to be found of carrying
out in time of peace, a systematic practice of this branch of torpedo
warfare, under circumstances similar to those experienced in war time,
and this is not only possible, but practicable.</p>

<p><i>Moral Effect of Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;We now come to the moral effect of
torpedoes, which is undoubtedly the very essence of the vast power of
these terrible engines of war. Each successive war that has occurred,
in which the torpedo has taken a part, since Captain Bushnell's futile
attempt in 1775 to destroy our fleet by drifting numerous kegs charged
with gunpowder down the Delawarre, teem with proofs of the great
worth of torpedoes in this respect alone.</p>

<p>That such a dread of them should and always will be met with in
future Naval wars, at times creating a regular torpedo scare or funk, is
not extraordinary, when it is remembered that these submarine
weapons of the present day, are capable of sinking the finest ironclad
afloat, and of launching into eternity without a moment's warning or
preparation, whole ships' crews.</p>

<p>The torpedoes existing at the present day have, without doubt,
reached a very high degree of excellence, in so far as their construction,
fuzes, cables, &amp;c., both electrically and mechanically, is concerned, but
much has yet to be done to develop their actual effectiveness.</p>

<p>The result of the numerous and exhaustive experiments that have
of late years been carried out by England, America, and Europe prove
that the necessary distances between stationary submarine mines are
by far greater than those within which the explosions are effective.</p>

<p>Therefore it will be found necessary to supplement those submarine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
harbour defences, by automatic torpedoes that can be controlled and
directed from the shore, as well as by specially constructed torpedo
boats.</p>

<p><i>Automatic Arrangements.</i>&mdash;And to ensure certainty, which is
the desideratum in torpedo warfare, circuit closers, or other automatic
arrangements for exploding the submarine mines, must be
employed, as the system of firing them by judgment is not at all a
sure one.</p>

<p><i>Ship Defence.</i>&mdash;The problem, which occupies the attention of Naval
and other scientific men, at the present day, is how best to enable a
ship to guard herself against attacks from the fish and other automatic
torpedoes, and this without in any way impairing her efficiency as a
man-of-war.</p>

<p>The means of such defence, should most certainly be inherent in
the vessel herself, outward methods, such as nets, booms, etc., are to
great extent impracticable, besides one of the above mentioned
torpedoes, being caught by such obstructions would, on exploding,
most probably destroy them, thus leaving the vessel undefended
against further attacks.</p>

<p><i>Mechanical Mines.</i>&mdash;Several ingenious methods have of late been
devised for the purpose of obviating one of the principal defects
common to all kinds of mechanical submarine mines, the most efficient
and practical of which will be found fully described in the following
pages, viz., the great danger attendant on the mooring of such mines;
but as yet, no really practical mode of rendering mechanical mines
safe, after they have once been moored and put in action, has been
discovered, were such to be devised, a very difficult and extremely
important problem of defensive torpedo warfare would be solved.</p>

<p><i>Electrical Mines.</i>&mdash;In regard to electrical submarine mines, much
has been done by torpedoists in general to simplify this otherwise
somewhat complicated branch of defensive torpedo warfare, by adopting
the platinum wire fuze, in the place of the high tension one, by
the employment of Leclanché firing batteries, by the simplification of
the circuit closer, and discarding the use of a circuit breaker, by altering
the form of torpedo case, and whenever possible by enclosing the
circuit closer in the submarine mine.</p>

<p>The necessity of a very elaborate system of testing should, if
possible, be overcome, for a system of submarine mines that requires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the numerous and various tests that are at the present day employed,
to enable those in charge of them to know for certain that when
wanted the mines will explode, cannot be considered as adaptable to
actual service. It must be remembered that the safety of many ports,
etc., will in future wars depend almost entirely on the practical
efficiency of electrical and mechanical mines. As yet, in actual war,
little or no experience has been gained of the real value of a mode of
coast defence by electrical mines, excepting from a moral point of
view, though in this particular they have most undoubtedly been
proved to be exceedingly effective.</p>

<p>A submarine mine much wanted on active service, is one that can
be carried on board ships, capable of being fitted for use at a moment's
notice, and of being easily and rapidly placed in position by the ordinary
boats of a man-of-war. It should be a self-acting electrical mine,
with the circuit closing apparatus enclosed in the torpedo case, and
capable of carrying about 100 lbs. of guncotton. This form of mine
would be found extremely useful to secure the entrance to a harbour,
etc., where ships might happen to be anchored for the night, or which
might have been wrested from the enemy, etc.</p>

<p>They should be capable of being placed in position and picked up
again, in the shortest possible space of time.</p>

<p><i>Offensive Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;Coming to the question of offensive torpedoes
there still seems to be a great difference of opinion as to the real value
of the Whitehead fish torpedo, and this point will never be finally
settled until that weapon has been more thoroughly tested on actual
service; from a specially built torpedo boat, by which is meant a
Thornycroft or Yarrow craft, the spar torpedo would seem to be the
most effective weapon. Torpedo vessels for the special purpose of
experimenting with the Whitehead torpedo have been built by
England, America, and several continental governments, so that we
may soon hope to get some more decided opinion as to the utility of
that weapon. When manipulated from the shore, or large ships, the
Lay torpedo boat, if only its speed be increased will prove an
exceedingly effective submarine weapon, for the purposes of offence,
active defence, or clearing harbours, etc., of mines, in fact, it may be
more truly said of this weapon, than of the Whitehead, "that it can
do everything but speak." Captain Harvey has greatly improved his
towing torpedo, but it is still a somewhat complicated and difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
weapon to manipulate by ordinary persons, that is, those not specially
trained for the work.</p>

<p>Drifting torpedoes under certain circumstances should prove invaluable,
but little or no improvement has been effected in this direction.
Submarine boats have also remained <i>in statu quo</i>, though for the
purpose of clearing an enemy's harbour of mines, it seems impossible
to devise any better method.</p>

<p>Electric lights are now universally adopted for use on board
ship, and will play a very important part in the defence of ships
against torpedo attacks in future wars. Glancing back on what has
been effected in the matter of improving the system of torpedo warfare
in all its branches during the last few years, with the exception of the
vast improvements in the form and construction of steam torpedo
boats, their engines, etc., very little has been done, owing principally
to the want of that practical knowledge which unfortunately can only
be gained from their employment in actual war.</p>

<p>The late Turco-Russian war afforded a splendid opportunity for
applying the crucial test of actual service to both the offensive and
defensive branches of torpedo warfare, yet little or no light was thrown
on the somewhat shadowy subject of submarine warfare. The present
struggle between Peru and Chili may furnish some experience, but it
will not be very satisfactory, as hardly any knowledge of manipulating
torpedoes is possessed by either side.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>DEFENSIVE TORPEDO WARFARE.&mdash;MECHANICAL MINES.&mdash;MECHANICAL
FUZES.&mdash;MOORING MECHANICAL MINES.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>BY defensive torpedo warfare is meant the protection of harbours,
rivers, etc., by means of various descriptions of torpedoes
moored beneath the surface of the water.</div>

<p>Submarine, or sea mine, is the term that has been generally
adopted to designate this particular species of torpedo.</p>

<p><i>Submarine Mines.&mdash;Defence in Future Wars.</i>&mdash;The very conspicuous
part played by submarine mines, in the many wars that have
taken place since the introduction of the torpedo as a legitimate mode
of Naval warfare, when their manipulation was comparatively little
understood, and construction very imperfect, proves that, with the
experience so gained, and the vast improvements that have been, and
are daily being effected, in all that appertains to the art of torpedo
warfare, the protection of harbours, etc., will in future wars depend
in a great measure on the adoption of a systematic and extensive
employment of submarine mines.</p>

<p>The utility and power of this mode of coast defence has been
fully exemplified in actual war, more especially during the Franco-German
war (1870-1) and the late Turco-Russian war (1877-8).</p>

<p><i>Torpedoes in the Franco-German War.</i>&mdash;In the former instance, the
superiority of the French over the Germans, in the matter of ships, was
more than neutralised, by the use on the part of the latter of electrical,
mechanical, and dummy mines for the protection of their harbours, etc.
In regard to the utility of the latter, it is on record that a certain German
port was entirely defended by dummy mines, the Burgomaster of that
place having been unable to obtain men to place the active mechanical
ones in position, owing to the numerous and serious accidents that had
previously occurred in other German ports at the commencement of
the war, in mooring the latter kind of submarine mine.</p>

<p>The effect, so far as keeping the French fleet at a distance was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
concerned, was precisely the same, as though active instead of
dummy mines had been employed, thus still further proving the vast
moral power possessed by torpedoes.</p>

<p><i>Torpedoes in the Russo-Turkish War.</i>&mdash;In the war of 1877, the
Turks, though possessing a powerful fleet in the Black Sea and flotilla
on the Danube, made little or no use of their superiority over the
Russians in this respect. They failed to even attempt to destroy the
bridges formed by the Russians over the Danube, nor did they make
any attempt to capture Poti, re-take Kustendje, or to create diversions
on the Russian coast in the Black Sea. Had the latter service alone
been effectually carried out, by which means, a large force of the enemy
would have been held in check, immense help would have been
afforded to the Ottoman armies in Europe and Asia. Again, during
the whole of the war, the Russian port of Odessa was never sighted,
and Sebastopol only once by the Ottoman fleet.</p>

<p><i>Cause of Failure of the Ottoman Fleet.</i>&mdash;The cause of this repeated
neglect on the part of the Turkish fleet may be traced almost entirely
to the assumption (which in nine out of ten cases was an erroneous
one) on the part of the Naval Pashas and Beys that every Russian
harbour, etc., was a mass of submarine mines, and this in several
instances extending many miles to seaward.</p>

<p>So also, some of the many failures experienced by the Russians in
their numerous torpedo boat attacks, were due in a great measure
to an erroneous supposition on the part of the captain of the Russian
steamer, <i>Constantine</i> (employed to convoy the torpedo boats), that the
Turks had defended the entrance, to a distance of some miles to
seaward, of their harbours, etc., and thus the torpedo boats were
dispatched to the attack some miles off the entrance, causing them,
owing to the darkness, to enter the harbour in which the Turkish
vessels were lying, in a very straggling manner. And to a similar
reason the failure of the Russians to capture Sulina, in the attack
made on that place in October, 1877, was principally owing to their
not daring to send their Popoffkas to attack from the sea.</p>

<p>One of the chief points of usefulness of an extensive and systematic
employment of submarine mines, will be to minimise the number
of vessels necessary for the protection of harbours, etc., thus enabling
a far larger number of ships to operate at sea against those of an
enemy, this especially applies to countries like England and America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
possessing a large extent of seacoast, numerous harbours, rivers, etc.,
which it would be necessary to defend in the event of war.</p>

<p><i>Science of Torpedo Warfare.</i>&mdash;The science of defensive torpedo
warfare may be considered to consist of:&mdash;</p>



<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;The arrangement of the mines in positions, such that it would
not be possible for a hostile vessel attempting to force a
passage into a harbour, etc., defended by such means, to
pass more than one line of them, without coming within
the destructive radius of some one or other of the
remaining mines.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The difficulty of attaining the above effect, lies in the fact
that the destructive radius of a submarine mine, is considerably less
than the distance that must be maintained between them, to prevent
injury by concussion to the cases, circuit closers, electric cables, etc., of
such mines on the explosion of an adjacent one.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the above, take the case of a 500 lb. guncotton
submarine mine. Now the destructive radius of a sea-mine is found
by the formula R = [3rt](32 × C), where R is the destructive radius in feet of
a mine moored at its most effective depth, and C is the charge
(guncotton) in lbs.</p>

<p>In the above case R would be about 24 feet, which in so far as the
actual destruction of a ship is concerned, may be taken as correct, but
if injury to a vessel's engines, boilers, etc., be also taken into consideration,
and as the vessel would most probably be underweigh on such an
occasion, this would be a very vital and important consideration, R
would under those circumstances be more than doubled. Now the
necessary interval for safety between such mines, according to torpedo
authorities, is equal to 10 R, and should certainly be not less than 8 R,
which in this case would give about 200 feet, therefore assuming the
radius of destruction to be 50 feet, it is seen that there would be under
those conditions a clear undefended space of about 100 feet between
each couple of 500 lb. mines in the same line.</p>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;The combined arrangement of submarine mines with forts
and batteries, in such a manner, that every one of the
former shall be well covered by the guns of the latter, and
also that it would be impossible for an enemy's ships to
get within effective range of the forts, or batteries, without
moving over ground where mines were laid.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This applies to the defence of the more important harbours,
etc., in which case the submarine mines (which would be chiefly
electrical ones) would only act as auxiliaries to the land defences. To
effectually carry out the above, there can be no question but that they
who plan the forts, etc., should also plan the systems of submarine defence.</p>

<p>A harbour, river, etc., which it is necessary to protect by electrical
submarine mines, etc., and where no land defences exist, should have its
mines supported by a powerful ship or ships, as maybe thought desirable.</p>

<p><i>Success in Torpedo Warfare.</i>&mdash;The two most important conditions
essentially necessary to the successful employment of torpedoes, both
offensive and defensive, are:&mdash;</p>


<ul>
<li>1. <span class="smcap">Certainty of Action.</span></li>
<li>2. <span class="smcap">Simplicity of Manipulation.</span></li>
</ul>


<p>Without the former this mode of Naval warfare is comparatively
useless, while without the latter the former condition is rarely obtained,
more especially in the case of offensive torpedoes.</p>

<p>Submarine mines are divided into separate classes, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1. <span class="smcap">Mechanical Mines.</span></li>
<li>2. <span class="smcap">Electrical Mines.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><i>Mechanical Mines.</i>&mdash;By this description of submarine mines, is
meant those whose charges are fired by mechanical means alone.</p>

<p><i>Mechanical Mines in the American Civil War.</i>&mdash;During the civil
war of America (1861-5), the Confederates depended almost entirely
on mechanical submarine mines for the protection of their harbours,
rivers, etc., and to this extensive use of such mines may be traced
nearly the whole of the Federal disasters afloat.</p>

<p>In the principal wars that have subsequently occurred, though this
form of submarine mine has been to a certain extent used, it has generally
been only as an auxiliary to the more effective electrical torpedo,
and owing to the deterrent effect produced by the numerous torpedo
successes that characterised the American Civil War, on Naval Commanders,
etc., few vessels have been destroyed by their means, the
effect of the employment of defensive torpedoes having been almost
wholly a moral one.</p>

<p><i>Mechanical Mines for Coast Defence.</i>&mdash;The experience hitherto
gained, with regard to the employment of mechanical mines for coast
defence in actual war, proves that they will be found exceedingly
valuable in the following positions:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;In combination with booms or other obstructions placed in
defence of narrow channels, etc., which are intended to be
completely blocked up.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;In shallow water on the flanks of electrical mines.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;In protecting unfrequented bays, channels, etc., and a long
line of seacoast, which may otherwise be entirely undefended.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In this latter instance, though the mines may not be
covered by any guns, still they will be of great use, in so far, that
being mechanical ones, they cannot be rendered useless by the process
of cutting cables, etc., but must be destroyed, which in time of peace is
a work of considerable labour and danger, and, therefore, would in the
time of war, cause at the very least, serious delay to an enemy desirous
of effecting a landing, etc., at a point so protected.</p>

<p>There are numerous objections against their employment, the
principal ones being:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;That they are all, more or less dangerous to place in position.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;That they cannot be tested when moored.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;That they are as dangerous to friend as to foe, when once
placed in action.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;That an exploded, or known damaged mine cannot be replaced.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The above objections, especially 2 and 3, constitute without
doubt very serious defects in a system of defence by mechanical
mines, and in the case of purely mechanical ones, it seems almost
impossible to eradicate any of them, though, notwithstanding, under
the particular circumstance before-mentioned, these species of defensive
torpedo will be found extremely useful.</p>

<p><i>The Advantages of Mechanical Mines.</i>&mdash;They possess a few
advantages, which are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;They are comparatively cheap.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;They can be kept in store and ready for use at a moment's
notice.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;They do not require specially trained men to manipulate
them.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;Extempore ones can be easily and readily made.</div>

<p><i>Best Kinds of Mechanical Mines.</i>&mdash;Among the very numerous and
various kinds of mechanical submarine mines that have been devised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the following may be considered as the most effective, and practicable
of them all:&mdash;</p>


<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Frame Torpedoes.</span></li>
<li>2.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Buoyant Mines.</span></li>
</ul>


<p>This includes:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li class='sub1'><i>a.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Barrel Mine.</span></li>
<li class='sub1'><i>b.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Brook's Mine.</span></li>
<li>3.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Singer's Mine.</span></li>
<li>4.&mdash;<span class="smcap">McEvoy's Improved Mine.</span></li>
<li>5.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Extempore Mine.</span></li>
</ul>


<p><i>Frame Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;This form of defensive mine is shown at Fig.
6. It consists of a frame work which is formed of four strong timbers
<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, these being kept parallel and only a few feet apart by
means of cross timbers <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>. A cast-iron torpedo <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, in the shape
of a shell, is bolted to the head of each of the timbers <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>,
containing about thirty pounds of fine grained gunpowder, and fitted
with a percussion fuse, which is so placed that it would come into
contact with a vessel striking against the framework, directly or not.
One end of the frame is securely anchored, the other, that on which the
torpedoes are fixed, is kept at its proper distance below the surface of the
water by means of chains, <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, and anchors. To prevent the frame
from sinking when sodden with water, the uprights <i>e</i>, <i>e</i>, are provided.</p>

<p>This form of mechanical mine, which performs the double function
of torpedo and obstruction, was much used by the Confederates, and
found extremely useful, no passage was attempted to be forced by the
Federals where these torpedoes were known to be placed.</p>

<p><i>Stake Torpedo.</i>&mdash;<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a> represents another form of the frame
torpedo.</p>

<p>It consists of a piece of timber, <i>a</i>, its heels secured by a heavy
metal shoe <i>b</i>, working in a universal joint in the mooring, <i>c</i>. At the
head of the piece of timber is secured a torpedo <i>d</i>, containing about
fifty pounds of gunpowder, and fitted with four or five sensitive fuzes.
The proper angle of inclination is obtained by securing the upper end
of the timber to an anchor as shown at <i>e</i>. As a proof of the efficiency
of this species of mechanical mine, even though having been in position
for a great length of time, the U.S. gunboat, <i>Jonquil</i>, was nearly
destroyed whilst attempting to remove some similar torpedoes which
had been in position for two years.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Barrel Torpedo.</i>&mdash;One description of this form of mechanical
submarine mine is shown at <a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>. It consists of a barrel <i>a</i>, to the
ends of which are attached two cones of pine <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, for the purpose of
preventing the current from turning the mine over.</p>

<p>To ensure its being watertight, pitch is poured into the interior
through the bunghole, and the barrel rolled about, so that the inside
may be evenly covered. The outside was also thoroughly coated with
pitch. These mines usually contain about 100 lbs. of gunpowder, and
are exploded by means of percussion or chemical fuzes (<i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>,) generally
five in number, screwed into sockets on each side and on the top of
the bilge of the barrels. To keep them upright a weight <i>d</i> is hung
below the mine.</p>

<p>This kind of mechanical mine was much used by the Confederates,
and to some extent by the Turks in their late war with Russia.</p>

<p>They are cheap, convenient, and under certain circumstances very
effective. One of the objections to their use is the difficulty of mooring
them securely in strong currents, as otherwise they are very liable
to shift their positions. Three Confederate vessels were "hoisted by
their own petards," from this cause.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<p><i>Brook's Torpedo.</i>&mdash;Another form of buoyant mechanical mine is
represented at <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>. It was designed for the express purpose of
preventing its discovery by dragging, etc., by the enemy. It consists
of the torpedo case <i>a</i>, formed of copper, which is attached to a spar <i>b</i>,
the lower end of which is secured to an universal joint in its anchor <i>c</i>.
Five percussion or chemical fuzes <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, are screwed into the head of
the copper case.</p>

<p><i>Turtle Torpedo.</i>&mdash;To increase the danger and uncertainty of any
attempt to remove this form of buoyant mine, a turtle torpedo <i>A</i>, is
attached to it by a wire <i>e</i>. This torpedo contains about 100 lbs. of
gunpowder, and is exploded by means of a friction primer which passes
through a watertight joint <i>f</i>, and is attached to the wire <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>Whether this combination would prove effective, has yet to be seen,
but the buoyant mine alone was considered one of the most dangerous
used by the Confederates.</p>

<p><i>Singer's Mechanical Mine.</i>&mdash;An elevation and section of this form
of mechanical mine is shown at <a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a>. It consists of an air chamber
<i>a</i>, and a powder chamber <i>b</i>; in the latter is fixed a rod of iron <i>c</i>, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
end of which rests in a cup formed in a lug <i>d</i>, where there is a screw
by means of which the rod <i>c</i> may be screwed against the bottom of
the torpedo case, on the interior. In the cup is placed the fulminating
substance. A heavy cast iron cap <i>A B</i> rests upon the top of the case
and is prevented from falling off by a low rim of tin, which enters an
aperture in the cap as at <i>e</i>: a wire <i>f</i> connects this cap with a pin <i>g</i>,
which keeps a plunger <i>h</i> at rest. The head of this plunger <i>h</i> is
directly beneath the bottom of the rod <i>c</i>, within the case; by means of
a spring <i>i</i>, directly the pin <i>g</i> is drawn out, which is done by a hostile
vessel striking against the mine and knocking off the cap <i>A B</i>, the
plunger <i>h</i> is forced against the bottom of the case and drives the rod
<i>c</i> into the cup containing the fulminate, and so explodes the torpedo.
The case of these mines, as used by the Confederates, was formed of
tin, and they contained from 50 to 100 lbs. of powder. A safety pin <i>k</i>
is provided to prevent a premature explosion due to the pin <i>g</i> being
accidentally withdrawn.</p>

<p>This form of submarine mine was one of the most successful and
most extensively employed of all, on the part of the Confederates.</p>

<p>Though no accidents are stated to have occurred in placing this
mine in position, yet the fact of the iron rod <i>c</i> having to be fixed for
action, and that close against the interior of the bottom of the case,
before the charge of powder has been put in, is an element of great
danger, for a comparatively slight blow beneath it, which might easily
occur in transport, etc., would explode the torpedo prematurely.</p>

<p><i>McEvoy's Improved Singer's Mine.</i>&mdash;To obviate this defect Captain
McEvoy has designed an improved mode of ignition for Singer's mine.
This is shown at <a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>. The form of case, and arrangement of heavy
cap are similar to those in Singer's mine. The mode of ignition is as
follows:&mdash;In the powder chamber <i>b</i> is fixed a friction fuze <i>f</i>, which by
means of a piece of wire secured to a length of chain <i>k</i>, <i>k</i>, is connected
with the heavy cast iron cap <i>A B</i>. The piece of wire passes through
a diaphragm of thin metal <i>h</i>, which is soldered all around, thus forming
a complete watertight joint. Premature explosion is prevented by
passing a link of the chain, through a slot in the bolt <i>c</i>, securing it
there by a pin of bent wire <i>l</i>. The dotted line of chain <i>k</i>, <i>k</i>, shows its
position during the process of mooring this form of Singer's torpedo.
The manner of lowering this and also Singer's mine is shown at <a href="#Fig_12">Fig.
12</a>. A buoy <i>x</i>, is attached by means of a line, in the former case to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>

<p><i>Mathieson's Cement Safety Plug</i>.&mdash;In the place of the safety pin
<i>l</i>, <a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>, employed by Captain McEvoy in his improved form of
Singer's mine, Quartermaster-Sergeant Mathieson, late Royal Engineers,
employs a plug or disc of soluble cement, so arranged that the
action of the sea-water after the mine has been placed in position
destroys the plug or disc, and so frees the chain which is connected
with the fuze and the heavy cap of the torpedo. This plan does away
with the necessity of using a buoy and line as shown in <a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>, and
also affords ample time for the men engaged in mooring the mine to
get far away before it is ready for action.</p>

<p><i>Mechanical Mine</i>.&mdash;The extempore mechanical submarine mine,
shown at <a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>, will be found to possess all the qualities which are
necessary to a perfect mine of that description.</p>

<p>It is extremely simple, it can be readily and quickly made, all the
materials of which it is constructed are at hand on board every man-of-war,
and it is certain in its action.</p>

<p>It consists of a barrel <i>a</i>, which is thoroughly coated inside and out
with hot pitch, etc., to make it watertight, a block of wood <i>b</i>, secured
to the top of the cask <i>a</i>, and having a recess cut in it to receive a
round shot <i>c</i>, also a hole through which a strop <i>d</i>, is passed, and
another hole to receive a toggle <i>e</i>. At the bottom of the cask on the
inside, is fixed a wooden frame work <i>f, f</i>, to the top of which two
ordinary gun friction tubes are fixed <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>. A piece of wood <i>h</i>, is
secured to the bottom of the cask on the outside, bored with two holes,
one to receive a thin iron rod <i>i</i>, the other for the safety pin <i>k</i>. Wires
<i>x</i>, <i>x</i>, secure the gun tubes <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>, to one end of the iron rod <i>i</i>, the other
end of which is connected by means of a rope lanyard to the shot <i>c</i>.
Weights are slung beneath the barrel to keep the mine upright. The
principle of action of this form of mechanical mine is precisely similar
to that of Captain McEvoy's improved Singer's mine, and need not,
therefore, be described.</p>

<p><i>McEvoy's Mechanical Primer</i>.&mdash;A sectional view of this apparatus
is represented by <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>. It consists of two brass tubes fitting
accurately one within the other, of which <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, is the inner one. To
this inner tube are affixed two brass diaphragms <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>. A brass spindle
<i>c</i>, carries a weight <i>d</i>, which is regulated by a spring, <i>e</i>. A locking rod,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
<i>f</i>, moves in a ball and socket joint at <i>g</i>. A hammer <i>h</i>, which is shown
in <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>, at full cock, is kept in that position by the rod <i>f</i>. A vessel,
striking the mine, in which this apparatus is placed causes the weight,
<i>d</i>, to cant over, allowing the rod, <i>f</i>, to be forced upwards by means of
the spring <i>e</i>, and so frees the hammer <i>h</i>, which falls on a nipple <i>i</i>, on
which is placed the percussion substance, and so explodes the mine.</p>

<p><i>McEvoy's Papier Maché Safety Plug.</i>&mdash;To prevent a premature
explosion during transport, etc., of a mine in which this apparatus is
placed, a plug of papier maché, which is soluble in water, is inserted in
the two spaces <i>p</i>, <i>p</i>, by which the spindle <i>c</i>, is prevented from moving
to one side or the other. The use of a papier maché, instead of a
cement plug for the purposes of safety, is a great improvement, as by
the simple process of pressure, any period of time that it is necessary
should elapse before the complete destruction of the plug, can be
readily and certainly obtained, which when a cement plug, formed of
different ingredients is used, is not always the case.</p>

<p><i>McEvoy's Mechanical Mines.</i>&mdash;Captain McEvoy has also devised a
plan, whereby a mechanical mine of the foregoing form may be placed
in a state of safety, even after it has been rendered active. In the
place of the aforesaid papier maché wad at <i>p</i>, <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>, he uses a
plunger which fits into the cavity <i>p</i>, of the heavy weight <i>d</i>. This
plunger is always kept in a position clear of the weight by means of
a spiral spring, unless it is desired to render the mine inactive when
the plunger is forced into the aforesaid cavity and kept there by means
of a pin inserted above it. Above this there is another plunger, acted
on by a spiral spring sufficiently powerful to enable it to force the
previous mentioned plunger into the safety position; this upper
plunger is rendered inactive by means of a pin. The mine being
placed in position, that pin which is keeping the lower plunger
inserted in the cavity <i>p</i>, of the weight <i>d</i>, is withdrawn and the mine
rendered active. To the pin of the upper plunger is attached a line
which is anchored some distance from the mine in a known position.
Then to render the mine inactive for the purpose of picking it up, etc.,
it is only necessary to raise the aforesaid line, and draw out the pin of
the upper plunger, which by means of the strong spiral spring will force
the lower plunger into the safety position, and render the mine inactive.</p>

<p>Whether this invention is a practicable one or not, remains to be
proved, but anyhow it is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span><i>Abel's Mechanical Primer.</i>&mdash;This is shown in section and elevation
at <a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a> (<span class="small">A</span> and <span class="small">B</span>). <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, is the powder chamber in which the
priming charge is placed; <i>b</i> is a screw plug to close the chamber;
<i>c</i> is a flexible india rubber tube; <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, are screw bands; <i>e</i> is
a glass tube containing oil of vitriol enclosed in a lead tube; <i>f</i> which
contains the explosive mixture; <i>g</i>, an eye at the head of the primer to
receive the firing line; <i>h</i>, <i>h</i> are segmental guards; <i>i</i> is the guard ring;
and <i>j</i> the safety screw pin. This apparatus is screwed into a socket in
the upper part of the torpedo case, as shown at <a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a> (<span class="small">C</span>).</p>

<p><i>Mode of Action.</i>&mdash;When placed in position, to render the primer
ready for action, the guard ring, <i>i</i>, is pulled off, first having removed
the safety pin <i>j</i>, when the segmental guards <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>, will fall away,
leaving the india rubber tube <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, exposed.</p>

<p>A sufficient strain being brought on the rope secured to the ring <i>g</i>,
the lead tube <i>f</i> bends, causing the fracture of the glass tube <i>e</i>, thus
igniting the priming charge and exploding the mine.</p>

<p>A submarine mine so fitted may be fired at will, by bringing a line,
from the ring <i>g</i>, to the shore, or it may be made self-acting by
connecting two of them together, etc.</p>

<p><i>Percussion and Chemical Fuzes.</i>&mdash;Many forms of this mode of
mechanical ignition have been from time to time devised, of which the
following are the most important ones:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sensitive Fuze.</i>&mdash;It consists of an inner cylinder <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>, of
composition metal, 1-1/2" diameter, and 2-1/2" long, having a thread cut
on its outside, and a bouching <i>b</i>, 2-1/4" diameter and 2" long with a
sexagonal projection <i>c</i>, for applying a wrench, also with an external
and internal thread. The upper end of the inner cylinder <i>a</i>, is solid
for 1", and is perforated by three holes <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, in each of which a percussion
primer is placed <i>e</i>, <i>e</i>. A piece of thin, soft and well annealed
copper <i>f</i> is soldered to the upper end of the bouching <i>b</i>, to keep
moisture from the primers, and is so thin that a slight blow will crush
without breaking it. A safety cap can be screwed on to the external
thread above the projection <i>c</i>.</p>

<p><i>Rain's Detonating Composition.</i>&mdash;The detonating composition employed
in this and many other forms of percussion fuzes by the
Confederates, etc., consisted of a combination of fulminate of mercury
and ground glass, and was invented by, and is named after, General
Rains, Chief of the Torpedo Bureau, at Richmond, during the Civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
War (1861-5). So sensitive was this composition that seven pounds
pressure, applied to the head of one of the primers, would explode it.</p>

<p>When required for use the internal cylinder <i>a</i>, containing the
primers <i>e</i>, <i>e</i>, is screwed up until contact between them and the copper
cap <i>f</i> is secured.</p>

<p><i>McEvoy's Percussion Fuze.</i>&mdash;<a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a> represents a longitudinal
section, full size, of the mechanical percussion fuze, used by Captain
McEvoy in connection with his drifting torpedo, which latter will be
hereafter described. <i>a</i> is a piece of metal, having an external and
internal thread, and a projection <i>b</i>, to which is applied the spanner for
screwing it into the torpedo case. This piece <i>a</i> is hollow at its upper
end, and is closed by means of a thin copper dome <i>c</i>, which is soldered
to it. Screwed into the piece <i>a</i> is the plug, or nipple <i>d</i>, with a hole
through it from end to end, it is rammed full of mealed powder, and
then a fine hole is drilled through the composition. A cavity <i>e</i> at the
head of the plug, or nipple <i>d</i>, is filled with a fulminating substance.
A spiral spring <i>f</i>, encircles the plug <i>d</i>, on which a cap <i>g</i> rests; <i>h</i> is a
needle in this cap. The action of this fuze will be readily understood
from the plan of the fuze at <a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>. A safety cap is provided, which
fits into the slots <i>i</i>, <i>i</i>, and is fixed there by means of a set screw.</p>

<p><i>Improved Form of Jacobi's fuze.</i>&mdash;The section shown in Fig. 17
is an improved form of the chemical fuze, invented by Professor Jacobi,
and used by the Russians in their land and sea mines during the
Crimean war (1854-5). It consisted of a small glass tube <i>a</i>, containing
sulphuric acid, enclosed in a lead cylinder <i>b</i>. A mixture of chlorate of
potash and white sugar surrounds the tube and holds it in position; <i>c</i>
is a primer filled with mealed powder in connection with the charge of
the mine. The action of this fuze is as follows:&mdash;On a vessel striking
against the lead cylinder <i>b</i>, it is crushed in, breaking the glass tube
containing the sulphuric acid, and thus causes it (acid) to flow into the
mixture of chlorate of potash and white sugar, producing fire, which
by means of the primer <i>c</i>, passes into the charge, and explodes the
mine.</p>

<div class="caption">MECHANICAL FUZES.</div>
<img src="images/i_044.jpg" width="500" height="776" alt="Plate V" /><a id="Plate_V"></a>
</div>

<p><i>Defect of Chemical Fuze.</i>&mdash;The defect of the chemical fuze just
described is its slow rate of ignition when compared to gunpowder.
This may be remedied by adding a small quantity of sulphuret of
antimony or perro cyanide of potassium.</p>

<p>Both the Turks and the Germans employed, as a mode of ignition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
for their mechanical submarine mines, the chemical fuze described
above, with but slight modifications in the shape of the lead cylinder
and manner of fixing the fuze into the torpedo case.</p>

<p>Mechanical fuzes, both percussion and chemical, which require
a blow to effect their ignition, are to a certain extent defective
when applied to submarine mechanical mines (which are always
buoyant ones) in so far that a hostile vessel passing over ground
supposed to be defended by torpedoes of any description, would do
so at as slow a rate of speed as it would be possible to proceed at,
and would, under those circumstances, <i>push away</i> rather than strike
a buoyant mine, with which she might come in contact. During the
American civil war and the Russo-Turkish war, especially in the
former, there are several instances on record of vessels passing over
buoyant mechanical mines unharmed, whilst similar vessels have
afterwards been destroyed by those self-same mines; and the only
cause for such apparent inconsistency being the above-mentioned one,
viz., the pushing rather than striking effect produced on a buoyant
mine by a vessel under weigh proceeding at a very slow speed, or
merely drifting with the current.</p>

<p><i>Steward's Safety-Cock Arrangements.</i>&mdash;To obtain security to a
certain extent in placing mechanical submarine mines in position,
which, as has been previously stated, is one of the defects common
to all forms of such torpedoes, many ingenious methods have
been devised, such as safety caps to their fuzes, safety pins, soluble
plugs, &amp;c. Another method, suggested by Captain Harding Steward,
R.E., which it is intended should be used in connection with
the other safety arrangements, is shown at <a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>. It consists
of a stop-cock <i>A</i>, which, in connection with a tube, is introduced
between the fuze and the charge. It is so arranged that when
the cock is turned in the direction of the tube, as shown in
section <i>B</i> at <i>e</i>, the gas on formation can pass easily through and
explode the charge; but when the cock is shut off, the gas on
formation escapes through the side <i>d</i>, as shown in section <i>C</i>. To
prevent destruction of the charge through leakage under the pressure
of the water, the cone in connection with the stop-cock should fit
very accurately, and, as an additional preventive, the escape hole
should be covered with a waterproof plaster, which at a moderate
depth would keep the water out and yet offer no material resistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to the escape of the gas if the stop-cock were shut off, as at <i>C</i>. The
efficiency of this arrangement, as far as relates to its cutting off the
gas from the charge, has been satisfactorily proved by practical
experiments.</p>

<p><i>Mooring Mechanical Mines.</i>&mdash;This description of defensive torpedo
will rarely be used in deep-water channels, &amp;c., and on account of
the impossibility of ascertaining whether such a mine has drifted
or otherwise, it should not be moored in a very rapid current.
Such being the case, an ordinary mushroom anchor, heavy stone,
&amp;c., and single steel wire mooring-rope, will be generally found
quite sufficient to keep such mines in position.</p>

<p>When only a few mechanical submarine mines are moored in
position, and at some distance apart, it would be found a useful plan
to moor them each with three anchors, one anchor being up-stream.
By this method, at low water, on the up-stream anchor being raised,
the mine would show itself, and might in that position be approached
and rendered inactive. Were this plan to be adopted when several
such mines are in position, there would be the danger of the up-stream
anchor on being raised, bringing up to the surface, and
probably in contact with the boat at work, a mine to which that
particular anchor does not belong, an explosion being the result.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>DEFENSIVE TORPEDO WARFARE&mdash;<i>continued</i>.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>BY electrical submarine mines is meant those whose charges are
ignited by the agency of electricity.</div>

<p><i>Submarine Mines during the Crimean and American Wars.</i>&mdash;It was
during the Crimean war (1854-6) that this description of defensive
torpedoes was for the first time employed on actual service. Several
of the principal Russian harbours were protected by this form of
submarine mine, but owing to the smallness of their charges, and to
the want of electrical knowledge on the part of the Russian officers
and men in charge of them, none of the ships of the Allies were sunk,
or even rendered <i>hors de combat</i> by this mode of harbour defence, though
in several instances ground known to be covered with submarine mines
was passed over by both English and French vessels of war.</p>

<p>Subsequently the Confederates, during the American civil war,
employed electrical submarine mines in considerable numbers for the
defence of their numerous harbours, rivers, &amp;c.; but though in so far as
the size of the torpedo charges was concerned, they did not make the
same mistake as the Russians, yet, owing to the absence of proper
electrical apparatus, and the want of any practical knowledge of the
manipulation of electrical sea mines, on the part of the Confederate
torpedoists, they were almost entirely unsuccessful in destroying the
Federal warships; the <i>Commodore Jones</i> being the sole instance,
out of the large number of vessels belonging to the Northerners which
were sunk and severely injured by torpedoes, of a war steamer being
sunk by means of electrical submarine mines.</p>

<p>In the Franco-German and Russo-Turkish wars which have lately
occurred, electrical sea mines were very extensively used in coast
defence, but with the exception of the loss of the gunboat <i>Suna</i> to
the Turks, during the latter struggle, by this form of defensive torpedo,
no other damage to vessels resulted from their use, yet owing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
vast moral power possessed by these submarine weapons, they were
enabled to most effectually carry out the work of defence entrusted to
their care.</p>

<p>Of late years many important discoveries have been made in the
science of electricity, and vast improvements have been effected in
electrical apparatus, to which causes may be traced the vastly
improved system of electrical submarine mines as adopted by the
English, American, and principal European governments at the
present day, as compared with those that have hitherto been employed.</p>

<p>The certainty of action when required of electrical submarine
mines, which is of course the desideratum of all torpedoists, has, by the
improved mode and manner of ascertaining the exact electrical
condition of each particular mine, and of the system as a whole, which
is at present in vogue, been made almost absolute.</p>

<p><i>Advantages of Electrical Submarine Mines.</i>&mdash;This form of defensive
torpedo possesses numerous important advantages, the principal of which
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;They are always absolutely under control.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;By detaching or connecting the firing battery, which is
effected by means of a plug, key, &amp;c., they may be respectively
rendered harmless, or dangerous. Thus friendly ships may pass over
them in safety, whilst those of the enemy are debarred from so doing.
On this account harbours, &amp;c., protected by such mines are termed
"Harbours of refuge."</p>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;Fresh mines may be added to a system of such defensive
torpedoes, thereby allowing an exploded mine to be replaced.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This is a very important point in connection with a system
of defence by submarine mines, as in the case of a deep water channel,
a hostile vessel being sunk by one of them, would not become an
obstruction, as, were the channel a comparatively shallow one would
most probably be the result, and therefore it would be necessary to
put a fresh mine in the place of the exploded one; this would also
apply were a mine to be prematurely ignited, or if any portion of its
firing apparatus were injured.</p>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;At night, or in a fog, no vessel can pass through a channel,
&amp;c., so protected without affording a means of ascertaining
her presence.</div>

<div class='hang2'><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This is also a very important advantage of a system of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
defence by electrical sea mines, affording as it does a complete
safeguard against surprise.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;The power of obtaining proof, without going near it, by a
system of testing that the electrical condition of the mine,
&amp;c., is perfect.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This again is an extremely important point. For were a
charge to become wet, one of the electric cables of the mine broken, or
damaged, &amp;c., it would instantly be made apparent at the firing station,
and could be at once remedied.</p>

<div class='hang2'>5.&mdash;They can be raised for examination, or removed when no longer
required, with ease and safety.</div>

<p>Such are some of the chief advantages of employing the agency of
electricity to effect the ignition of the charge in a system of defence by
submarine mines.</p>

<p><i>Defects of Electrical Submarine Mines.</i>&mdash;The following are the chief
defects connected with the use of electrical mines:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;The number of wires that are required to be used with them.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;The necessity of employing specially trained men in their
manipulation.</div>

<p>In time there seems little doubt but that the former obstacle will
be to a considerable extent overcome, but the latter must always be
a flaw in an otherwise perfect system of coast defence by submarine
mines.</p>

<p><i>Rules to be observed in using Electrical Submarine Mines.</i>&mdash;In connection
with a system of electrical submarine mines the following rules
should be carefully observed:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;They should be moored in deep channels, that is to say, where
the larger class of vessels would in attempting to force a
passage be obliged to go.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Mechanical submarine mines should never be used under
these circumstances, as the difficulties of mooring them and keeping
them in position would be very considerable, also a vessel being
sunk in a very deep channel would not necessarily block it, and as
a mechanical mine cannot be replaced, a gap would be left in the
defence.</p>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;They should be placed in the narrowest parts of the channel.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The object of this rule is evident, fewer mines being
required, and consequently in the case of electrical ones, a far less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
number of wires are needed, which gives an increase of simplicity,
and consequently more effectiveness. This point should be observed
in connection with mechanical, as well as electrical submarine mines.</p>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;They should where practicable be moored on the ground.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The advantages attendant on an observance of this
rule are:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'><i>a.</i>&mdash;Increased vertical effect.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>b.</i>&mdash;Avoidance of mooring difficulties.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>c.</i>&mdash;Less liability of shifting from its original position.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>d.</i>&mdash;Less chance of its being discovered and rendered useless by
an enemy.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>e.</i>&mdash;By far heavier charges may be conveniently employed.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;Where possible, no indication whatever should be given of the
position of the mines by their circuit closers, or in the
case of small buoyant ones, by the mines themselves.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In some instances this will be almost impracticable, as
for example, where there is a very great rise and fall of tide. For
instance, at Noel Bay in the Bay of Fundy, the rise is over fifty feet.
Here, when circuit closers, or small buoyant mines are used, both of
which ought never to be more than twenty feet below the surface,
long before low water they would be found floating on the surface in
full view. Many attempts have been made to overcome this difficulty,
but as yet no really practicable means have been devised.</p>

<div class='hang2'>5.&mdash;The stations where the firing batteries, &amp;c., are placed, should
be in the defensive work likely to be held the longest, thus
enabling the mines to be commanded up to the last moment.</div>

<div class='hang2'>6.&mdash;The electric cables should be laid in positions such that their
discovery by the enemy would be extremely difficult, and
almost impossible.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This may be to a certain extent effected by leading them
from the mines to the firing and observing stations by circuitous
routes, and by burying them in trenches.</p>

<div class='hang2'>7.&mdash;They should not be thrown away on boats.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Notes.</span>&mdash;As they can in all cases be fired by will, even when
circuit closers are used, this rule is easily observed. But to prevent
an enemy's boats from rendering the mines useless, a line of small
torpedoes might be placed in advance of the large ones, or the
circuit closers themselves might be charged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>At night, or in foggy weather it will be necessary to employ
guard-boats, electric lights, &amp;c., to protect them against damage by an
enemy's boats, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the foregoing pages of this chapter will be found the requirements
and conditions essential to a perfect system of electrical submarine
mines for the defence of a harbour, river, &amp;c.; in the following
pages a general description of the component parts of such defensive
torpedoes, under the following heads&mdash;Form and Construction of
Case; Electrical Fuzes; Electric Cables; Watertight Joints; Junction
Boxes; and Mode of Mooring, will be considered.</p>

<p><i>Form and Construction of Torpedo Case.</i>&mdash;The case of a submarine
mine should be capable of fulfilling the following conditions:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1. It must be able at great depths to withstand a great pressure of
water, and remain perfectly watertight.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This in the case of a charge of gunpowder being an
imperative necessity.</p>

<div class='hang2'>2. As a buoyant mine, it must be capable of affording a considerable
excess of buoyancy, by which it may be rendered
stationary when moored.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This is generally obtained by having an air space within
the torpedo, thus requiring a much larger case in which the charge
is enclosed than would otherwise be necessary, causing increased
difficulties in transportation, mooring, and raising them for examination, &amp;c.</p>

<div class='hang2'>3. When explosive agents which require a certain time for
thorough combustion are used as the charge, such as
gunpowder, picric powder, gun-cotton (not fired by detonation),
&amp;c., a much stronger case is necessary to obtain the
full explosive effect than would be the case were detonated
charges, under the same conditions, employed.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This is an extremely important point, for if a weak case
is employed with a charge of gunpowder, &amp;c., fired by a fuze primed
with powder only, a portion of it on being fired would generate a
sufficient quantity of gas to burst the case, thus blowing out the
remainder of the charge before its ignition had been effected.</p>

<div class='hang2'>4. It should be of such a form that the complete ignition of the
charge is obtained by the employment of the least number
of fuzes possible to effect this result.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This point is especially to be observed when gunpowder
is the explosive agent.</p>

<p>The various forms of defensive torpedo cases may be classed under
the following heads:&mdash;</p>


<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;Spherical shape.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;Cylindrical shape.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;Conical shape.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Spherical Shape.</i>&mdash;This form of case is theoretically the very best
one possible to devise, but on account of the difficulty of constructing
it, and its comparative costliness, such a form may be put aside as
being impracticable.</p>

<p><i>Cylindrical Shape.</i>&mdash;Torpedoists in general have hitherto adopted
the cylindrical form of case as being the best adaptable for both
ground and buoyant mines containing a heavy charge.</p>

<p>The Confederates employed exclusively this shape for their
electrical submarine mines, which were ground ones, and the
Austrians in the war of "66" approved of this form of case for their
electrical submarine mines, which were buoyant ones. <a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a> and
<a href="#Fig_20">20</a> represent respectively the American and Austrian mines.</p>

<p>In England the cylindrical shape has up to quite lately found
most favour with her torpedoists for both buoyant and ground mines.
At <a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a> is represented a 100-lb. buoyant electrical mine, surrounded
by a wooden jacket, <i>e</i>, and having its circuit closer, <i>C</i>,
enclosed within it; and at <a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a> is shown a 250-lb. electrical mine,
which may be used either as a buoyant or ground one.</p>

<p>For large ground mines, the best form of torpedo case seems to
be that of the turtle mine, which is shown at <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>. A heavy charge
may be contained in it; it forms its own anchor; and it would withstand
an explosion of an adjacent mine without sustaining any injury.
At present the cylindrical shape is the form generally used, though as
far as retaining its position on the ground in a strong tide, it cannot
be compared to the turtle form.</p>

<div class="caption">FORM OF CASE OF SUBMARINE MINES.</div>
<img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="500" height="781" alt="Plate VI" /><a id="Plate_VI"></a>
</div>

<p><i>The Conical Shape.</i>&mdash;Hitherto this shape of submarine mine case
was only used in connection with mechanical mines, but now it is the
form considered most suitable for all buoyant mines, electrical or
mechanical. At <a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a> is shown the conical shaped mechanical
mine, employed by the Confederates for use with sensitive fuzes. The
conical form of torpedo case lately approved of by the English torpedo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
authorities is somewhat similar to that one, the charge being contained
in a kind of box hung from the top of the case, and the circuit closer
is screwed into the bottom of the case; surrounding the upper part
of the case is a thick buffer of wood, by which damage to the mine
is prevented by the passage of friendly ships. This is altogether a
very neat and serviceable form of torpedo case. This form of case is
also more difficult to discover by dragging, and easier to retain in
position.</p>

<p><i>Electrical Fuzes.</i>&mdash;The fuzes employed in connection with electrical
submarine mines may be divided into two classes:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1. Platinum wire bridge fuzes.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;That is where the evolution of heat is caused by a large
<i>quantity</i> of the electric force flowing through a good conductor of
large section, such as the copper core of electric cables, being
suddenly checked by a very thin wire composed of a metal which
compared with the conductor offers a very great resistance, such as
<i>platinum</i>.</p>

<div class='hang2'>2. High tension fuzes.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;That is where the evolution of heat is caused by the electric
spark, or by the electric discharge taking place through a substance
which offers very great resistance to the passage of the electric force.</p>

<p><i>Platinum Wire Fuze.</i>&mdash;This is the form of electrical fuze most commonly
used, and which will most certainly supersede altogether the
high tension fuze.</p>

<p>There are numerous advantages accruing from the use of platinum
wire fuzes, the chief of which are here enumerated:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'><i>a.</i>&mdash;Great facilities for, and entire safety whilst testing the circuit.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>b.</i>&mdash;Extreme simplicity of manufacture.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>c.</i>&mdash;Non-liability to deteriorate.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>d.</i>&mdash;Perfect insulation of the electric cables used in connection with
submarine mines not necessary.</div>

<p><i>English Service Platinum Wire Fuze.</i>&mdash;The following is a description
of the platinum wire fuze of the form adopted in the English service, a
section of which is shown at <a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a>. It consists of a head of ebonite
<i>a</i>, hollowed out, in which a metal mould is fixed, the wires which have
been previously bared are inserted into holes in this mould, and firmly
fixed thereto by means of a composition poured into the mould, whilst
hot; this is shown at <i>b</i>. The two bared ends of the wires which project<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
beyond the metal mould, as <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, are connected by a bridge of platinum-silver
wire ·0014" in diameter and weighing ·21 grs. per yard. This is
effected as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>A very fine shallow groove is made in the flat ends of the bare wires
<i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, and the platinum-silver wire is laid across in the incisions, and
fixed there by means of solder. The length of the bridge <i>d</i> is ·25."</p>

<p>A tube <i>e</i>, made of tin, and soldered to a brass socket <i>f</i>, is fixed by
means of cement to the ebonite head <i>a</i>; in this tube is placed the
fulminate of mercury, the open end of the tube <i>g</i> being closed with a
pellet of red lead and shellac varnish; around the bridge of the fuze
is placed some loose gun-cotton.</p>

<p><i>McEvoy's Platinum Wire Fuze.</i>&mdash;Another form of platinum wire fuze,
which has been devised by Captain McEvoy, formerly of the Confederate
Service, is shown at <a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>. It consists of the head <i>a</i>,
formed of a mixture of ground glass, or Portland cement, worked up
with sulphur as a base: this mixture when hot is poured into a mould,
in which the two insulated copper wires, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, have been previously
placed; when cold, the mixture with the wires affixed is removed from
the mould, and the platinum wire bridge <i>c</i> being secured to the bare
ends of the copper wires, the whole is firmly fixed in a brass socket <i>d</i>,
by means of cement; the space <i>e</i> is filled with loose dry gun-cotton,
so as to surround the bridge <i>c</i>; a copper tube <i>f</i>, closed at one end, is
partly filled with fulminate of mercury, and when the fuze is required
for service, this tube is secured to the brass socket <i>d</i> by means of cement.</p>

<p>In this form of low tension fuze there is no liability whatever of
any injury being caused to the bridge by the working of the wires in
the head, or by damp even after lying in the water for a month or
more. One peculiarity of this fuze is that the composition is run over
the insulated wires without materially softening the dielectric, or
affecting in the slightest degree the insulation of the wires.</p>

<p><i>High Tension Fuzes.</i>&mdash;The high tension fuze was devised for use with
electrical submarine mines, in the place of the platinum wire fuze, on
account of the little knowledge possessed, in the early days of submarine
warfare, in regard to the manipulation of Voltaic batteries.</p>

<p>Platinum wire requires a temperature of some 500° F. to heat it to
incandescence, and therefore necessitates the use of a powerful Voltaic
battery, both in intensity and power, to effect the ignition of gunpowder
by this means at considerable distances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The Grove and Bunsen pile were the only suitable form of Voltaic
battery known at the period of the introduction of high tension fuzes,
both of which possessed the defects of uncertainty and inconstancy,
and also were by far too cumbersome and too difficult to keep in
effective working order to be of any real practicable value.</p>

<p>High tension fuzes may be ignited by means of either an electro-magneto
machine, an electro-dynamo machine, a frictional machine, or
by a Voltaic battery, generating an electric current of high intensity.
Various kinds of this form of electrical fuze have been designed, the
principal of which are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;Statham's fuze.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;Beardslee's fuze.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;Von Ebner's fuze.</li>
<li>4.&mdash;Abel's fuze.</li>
<li>5.&mdash;Extempore fuze.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Statham's Fuze.</i>&mdash;A section and elevation of this electric fuze are
shown at Fig. 26; <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> is a gutta percha tube, with an opening cut in it,
as shown in figure. The interior of this vulcanised gutta percha tube
is coated with a thin layer of sulphide of copper, which coating is
obtained by leaving a bare copper wire for some time in connection
with the above-mentioned tube. The extremities of two insulated
copper wires <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, considerably smaller than the conducting wires, are
uncovered, scraped, and then inserted into the tube <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, with an interval
of ·15 inch between them. The wires are then bent as shown
in the figure, and the priming placed between the terminals. The
whole is covered with a gutta percha bag, which is filled with fine
grained gunpowder. The priming substance is composed of fulminate
of mercury worked up with gum water. The objection to this fuze,
which was used by the Allies in their destruction of the Russian
fortifications at Sebastopol, is the want of sensitiveness of sulphide
of copper, and the consequent necessity of a very powerful firing
battery.</p>

<p><i>Beardslee's Fuze.</i>&mdash;This high tension fuze is shown at <a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>.
It consists of a cylindrical piece of soft wood a, which is about three-quarters
of an inch in length and in diameter; two copper nails,
<i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, are driven through this piece of wood <i>a</i>, in such a way that
while the two heads come together as close as possible without
absolutely touching, the pointed ends are some distance apart from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
each other, and project through the wood <i>a</i>; two insulated copper
wires, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, are firmly soldered to these projecting ends, and a piece of
soft wax, <i>d</i>, is pressed around the junction points. In a groove, across
the heads of the copper nails, is placed a little black lead, to which is
added a minute quantity of some substance, the nature of which is
known only to Mr. Beardslee. Several folds of paper are wrapped
round the wooden cylinder, forming a cylinder about 2-1/2 inches long,
one end of which is tightly fastened round the insulated wires as at <i>e</i>.
The other end of the cylinder is then filled with powder, <i>f</i>, and closed
by a piece of twine. The whole fuze is then coated with black varnish.
Though not highly sensitive, Beardslee's fuze is exceedingly efficient,
and extremely simple.</p>

<p><i>Von Ebner's Fuze.</i>&mdash;This form of fuze was devised by Colonel Von
Ebner of the Austrian Engineers. A section and elevation of it is
shown at <a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a>. It consists of an outer cylinder, <i>a</i>, of gutta percha,
and an inner one of copper, <i>b</i>, which latter encloses a core formed of
ground glass and sulphur, <i>c</i>, which core is cast round the two conducting
wires <i>d</i>, <i>d</i> in such a way that they are completely insulated from one
another. In the first instance the wire is in one continuous length, the
opening <i>e</i> being subsequently made, and carefully gauged, so as to
ensure a uniform break, or interval in the conductor of each fuze. The
priming composition, which consists of equal parts of sulphide of
antimony and chlorate of potash, is placed in the hollow <i>f</i>, to which is
added some powdered plumbago, for the purpose of increasing the
conducting power of the composition. This mixture is put into the
hollow, <i>f</i>, of the fuze under considerable pressure, the terminals being
connected with a sensitive galvanometer, in circuit with a test battery,
and the pressure applied so as to obtain, as far as possible, uniformity in
the electrical resistance of each fuze.</p>

<p>The Austrians employed this form of high tension fuze in connection
with a frictional machine for the electrical mines used in their defence
of Venice, &amp;c. during the war of 1866.</p>

<p><i>Abel's Fuze.</i>&mdash;Mr. Abel devised a high tension fuze, which in 1858
was extensively experimented with; the Beardslee and Von Ebner fuze
being based upon the principles applied for the first time in Abel's fuze.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a id="Fig_24"></a><a id="Fig_25"></a><a id="Fig_26"></a><a id="Fig_27"></a><a id="Fig_28"></a><a id="Fig_29"></a>
<div class="caption">ELECTRICAL FUZES.</div>
<img src="images/i_060.jpg" width="500" height="787" alt="Plate VII" /><a id="Plate_VII"></a>
</div>

<p>Many modifications of it have been from time to time devised by
Mr. Abel; a section and elevation of the more recent form of his fuze is
shown at <a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a>. It consists of <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, a body of beech wood, hollowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
for half its length, in which space the priming charge is placed; it is
also perforated by three holes, one vertical for the reception of the capsule
of sensitive mixture, the other two horizontal, in which the conducting
wires are placed; <i>a</i>, <i>a</i> are two insulated copper wires, passing into the
vertical hole, and resting on the sensitive mixture; in a cavity, <i>d</i>, of the
body of the fuze is placed some mealed powder, which is fired by the
ignition of the sensitive mixture on the passage of the electrical current.</p>

<p>The insulated wires used in connection with this fuze consist of two
copper wires, about 2 inches long, and ·022 inch in diameter, enclosed
in a covering of gutta percha ·13 inch in diameter, and separated about
·06 inch from each other.</p>

<p>At one end the wires are bared to 1·25 inch, at the other they are
merely cut across by a very sharp pair of scissors. This end of the
double covered wire is inserted into a paper cylinder <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, which holds
a small quantity of the priming mixture. This capped end of the
wires is inserted into the wooden body of the fuze through the vertical
hole <i>i</i>, and projects ·15 inch into the cavity <i>d</i>. The bare ends of the
double covered wires are pressed into small grooves in the head of the
cylinder <i>e e</i>, and each extremity is bent into one of the small channels
<i>d' d'</i>, which are at right angles to the vertical perforation. <i>d' d'</i> are two
small copper tubes driven into these channels over the wire ends, to
keep the wires in position, and to form the opening into which the
conducting wires <i>f</i> are inserted and bent round, as at <i>e'</i>.</p>

<p>The priming mixture of Abel's original fuze, which was the one
used by the Confederates, was composed of 10 parts of subphosphide
of copper, 45 parts of subsulphide of copper, and 15 parts of chlorate
of potash. These ingredients reduced to a very fine state of division,
and intimately mixed, in a mortar, with the addition of a little alcohol,
are dried at a low temperature and preserved in bottles until required
for use. The sensitive mixture used by Mr. Abel more recently for
his submarine electrical high tension fuzes, is composed of an intimate
mixture of graphite and fulminate of mercury. By the process of
ramming, the electrical resistance of the fuze is regulated.</p>

<p><i>Extempore Fuzes.</i>&mdash;It may be necessary in some cases, when a
specially manufactured fuze is not attainable, to make a fuze on the
spot. The following is a neat and simple method of constructing
an extempore high tension fuze.</p>

<p><i>Fisher's Extempore Fuze.</i>&mdash;This form of fuze was devised by Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
now Captain Fisher, R.N. It consists of a small disc of gutta
percha, through which the ends of two wires are inserted about
1/4 inch apart, their ends terminating in small copper plates formed
by hammering down the wire. These flat ends should be fixed
parallel, and in the first place in contact with one another, also should
be level with the surface of the gutta percha. The other two
extremities of the wires are then placed in circuit with a sensitive
galvanometer and a test battery; the needle of the former deflects
violently, there being a complete metallic circuit; the flat ends of the
wires or poles of the fuze are then separated very carefully, until the
needle just ceases to deflect. In the space thus formed, a little
scraped charcoal is placed, and rammed in by a piece of wood. By
the application of pressure, any degree of sensitiveness may be
attained, merely observing the deflection of the galvanometer needle.
Over the charcoal a little powdered resin is shaken, and pressed down,
by which means the charcoal is fixed in position, and owing to the
inflammability of the resin, the ignition of the gunpowder priming is
ensured. The disc of gutta percha is then placed in an empty Snider
ball cartridge, &amp;c., and by the application of a little warm gutta
percha applied externally, the holes where the projecting ends of the
wires pass are closed, and the disc is fixed and insulated. The case is
then filled with some mealed powder and fine grained powder, on the
top of which is placed a little cotton wool, and the whole pressed
down tightly with the finger, the open end of the case being then
choked, as in Beardslee's fuze and Abel's extempore one. The apex
is then covered with some warm gutta percha, and the whole of the
fuze coated over with red sealing-wax dissolved in methylated spirits.</p>

<p><i>Insulated Electric Cables.</i>&mdash;For the work of defence by electrical
submarine mines, the wires along which the electric current flows
have, on account of their being led underground and through the
water, to be covered with some substance which shall prevent the
current during its passage from escaping to earth, or in other words,
they (the wires) must be insulated.</p>

<p>The substances in general use for such purposes are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;Gutta percha.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;Ordinary india rubber.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;Hooper's material.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Gutta Percha.</i>&mdash;This substance was used by Messrs. Siemens in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
cables manufactured by them for the Austrian government in 1866,
and is to some extent still employed, though Hooper's material or
vulcanised india rubber, has been found to be more suitable. The
dielectric, gutta percha, possesses the following advantages:&mdash;</p>


<div class='hang2'><i>a.</i>&mdash;It can be put on the conducting wire, as an unbroken tube.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>b.</i>&mdash;It only absorbs 1 per cent. of water.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>c.</i>&mdash;It has the property of clinging to the metallic conductor, by
which is meant, that should it (conductor) be cut through,
and any strain be brought on the cable, there is a tendency
on the part of the gutta percha to cling to the conducting
wire, thereby not increasing the fault.</div>

<p>The defects of such an insulator are:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'><i>a.</i>&mdash;Its liability to become hard and brittle when exposed to dry
heat, and consequently it requires to be stored under water.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>b.</i>&mdash;It becomes comparatively a bad dielectric at 100° F.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>c.</i>&mdash;It becomes plastic at high temperatures, which causes the
conducting wire to alter its position.</div>

<p>In some particulars ordinary india rubber is a better insulator
than gutta percha, but this substance is equally inferior to Hooper's
material, &amp;c. The advantages possessed by this substance are:&mdash;</p>



<div class='hang2'><i>a.</i>&mdash;It is not easily affected by a dry heat.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>b.</i>&mdash;It is a very excellent dielectric.</div>

<p>The defects of this mode of insulation are:&mdash;</p>


<div class='hang2'><i>a.</i>&mdash;It must be put on the conducting wires in a series of jointed
pieces.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>b.</i>&mdash;It does not cling to the conducting wire, so that if the electric
cable be cut, and any strain be brought on it (cable), the
previous fault is increased.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>c.</i>&mdash;It absorbs 25 per cent. of water.</div>

<p><i>Hooper's Material.</i>&mdash;This insulating material consists of an inside
coating of pure india rubber, then another similar coating in conjunction
with oxide of zinc, which is termed the separator, and an outside
coating of india rubber combined with sulphur. The use of the
separator is to prevent any damage to the conducting wires by the
action of the sulphur. The three coatings are then baked for some
hours at a very high temperature, which fuses the whole into a solid
mass, and vulcanises the outer coating. The properties of the pure
india rubber which is in contact with the metallic conductor are thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
preserved, while any decay of the outer covering is prevented by
the vulcanising process.</p>

<p>The advantages claimed by Mr. Hooper for this mode of insulating
electric submarine cables, are:&mdash;</p>



<div class='hang2'><i>a.</i>&mdash;High insulation.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>b.</i>&mdash;Flexibility.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>c.</i>&mdash;Capability of withstanding the bad effects of dry heat.</div>

<p>The qualifications essential to a perfect insulated electrical cable
for use with submarine mines are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;Capacity to bear a certain amount of strain without breaking.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;Perfect insulation, or at least as nearly so as it is possible to
obtain, and composed of a substance capable of being
readily stored, and kept for a considerable length of time
without being injured.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;Pliability so that it may be wound on, or paid out from, a
moderately sized drum without injury.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;Provided with an external covering capable of protecting the
dielectric from injury when used in situations where there
is a rocky or shingly bottom, &amp;c.</div>

<p>The insulated wire of a submarine cable is technically spoken of as
its <i>core</i>.</p>

<p>By a <i>cable</i> is meant to be understood any piece of covered wire.</p>

<p>Several forms of submarine electrical cables have been devised, all
of which more or less possess the qualifications enumerated above. The
following are some of the most effective:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;Siemens's cable.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;Hooper's cable.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;Gray's cable.</li>
<li>4.&mdash;Service cable.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Siemens's Cable.</i>&mdash;This form of cable is represented at <a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a>. It
consists of a strand <i>a</i>, which is composed of three or more copper wires
formed by laying up the several single copper wires spirally, several
layers of gutta percha, or india rubber, <i>b</i>, two coverings of hemp,
saturated with Stockholm tar, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, and several plies of copper
tape <i>e</i>, wound on, so that each strip overlaps the preceding one, as
shown at <a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a>. The conductivity of the copper employed for the
strand is equal to at least 90 per cent. of that of pure copper.</p>

<p>This exterior covering of copper tape is a patent of Messrs. Siemens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Brothers, and when once laid down, the cable so covered is very
efficiently protected, and of course it is little affected by the action of
the sea water. This mode of protection has one great defect, viz., that
in the event of a kink occurring in paying out the line, and at the
same time a sharp strain being applied, the copper tape at that point
is extremely likely to destroy the insulation by being drawn in such
a way as to cut through the dielectric. On this account great care
must be observed in handling this form of cable.</p>

<p>In practice precautions must be taken to prevent the copper tape
covering from being brought into contact with any iron, for were
such to happen, electrical action would at once ensue, causing the iron
to corrode with enormous rapidity.</p>

<p>In some of Siemens's cables, vulcanised india rubber replaces the
gutta percha insulation. Iron covered cables, either galvanised or
plain, are manufactured as well as the copper tape covered ones by
that firm.</p>

<p><i>Hooper's Cable.</i>&mdash;This form of cable is represented at <a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a>. It
consists of a metal conducting wire, generally copper, <i>a</i>, covered with
an alloy to protect it from chemical action, the insulating substance <i>b</i>,
known as Hooper's material, previously described at <a href="#Page_39">page 39</a>, a
covering of tarred hemp <i>c</i>, and an outer covering of iron wires
(No. 11 B. W. G.), each of which is separately covered with tarred
hemp and wound on spirally, <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>Gray's cable is very similar to the one just described, the chief
difference in it as compared with Hooper's being the absence of the
separator.</p>

<p><i>Silvertown Cables.</i>&mdash;The following is a description of the core of an
electrical submarine cable, which is used by the English government,
and is supposed to contain all the advantages of the foregoing, and
none of their defects. It consists of a strand conductor of four copper
wires (No. 20 B. W. G.) of quality not less than 92 per cent. of pure
copper, and possessing an electrical resistance of not more than 14
ohms per nautical mile. This strand is tinned and insulated with
vulcanised india rubber to a diameter of ·24 inch, and then covered
with a layer of felt, and the whole subjected to a temperature of 300° F.
under steam pressure. This forms the core of the various kinds of
cables employed in connection with a system of defence by electrical
submarine mines, which are enumerated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;Single core armoured cable.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;Multiple cable.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;Circuit closer cable.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;Single core unarmoured cable.</div>

<div class='hang2'>5.&mdash;Special cables for firing by cross bearings.</div>

<p><i>Single Core Armoured Cable.</i>&mdash;This form of cable is used in connection
with each mine of a group or system, and also to connect forts, &amp;c.
across an arm of the sea. Over the core, which has been fully described,
is laid a spiral covering of tanned, picked Russian hemp, over this are
laid ten galvanised iron wires (No. 13 B. W. G.), each one of which is
covered with a similar hemp, which is laid in an opposite spiral to the
former similar covering, with a twist of one revolution in about thirteen
inches; in order to prevent these wires from gaping when the cable is
kinked, a further covering of two servings of hemp passed spirally in
opposite directions is laid, and the whole passed through a hot composition
of a tar and pitch mixture. Exterior diameter of this cable is
7/8 inch. Its weight in air is 27-50/112 cwt., and in water 14-40/112 cwt. per
nautical mile. The breaking strain of a cable thus manufactured is
62-1/2 cwt., and its cost about £47 per nautical mile. A diagram of this
cable is shown at <a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>.</p>

<p><i>Multiple Cable.</i>&mdash;This form of cable is employed in cases where it
is necessary to carry a large number of cables into the firing station,
&amp;c. It consists of seven single cores formed into a strand, over which a
padding of hemp fibres is laid longitudinally, and over this again is
laid an armouring of sixteen (No. 9 B. W. G.) galvanised iron wires, each
one of which is covered with a layer of tarred tape put on spirally with
a twist of one revolution in 15 inches. The exterior covering consists of
two layers of hemp and composition, which is laid on with a short
twist, and in opposite directions. The external diameter of this cable
is 1-1/4 inch. Its weight in air and water is 78-25/112 cwt., and 45-32/112 cwt.
respectively per nautical mile. Its breaking strain is 135 cwt., and
cost about £357 per nautical mile. This form of cable is used in connection
with a junction box, from which the single armoured cables
leading to the different mines radiate, and is shown at <a href="#Fig_33">Fig. 33</a>.</p>

<p><i>Circuit Closer Cable.</i>&mdash;This cable, which connects the mine and
circuit closer, has been found to be subjected to exceptional wear and
tear, and therefore requires a special form of exterior protection. The
core of this cable is the same as the one described at <a href="#Page_41">page 41</a>, also it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
covered with a similar padding of hemp, but instead of the iron wires
as in the case of the multiple cable, &amp;c., nine strands, each of which is
composed of fourteen No. 22 Bessemer Steel Wires, are wound on, each
such strand being covered with hemp, which is put on with a twist of
one revolution in every 7-1/2 inches, the external covering being the same
as in other cables.</p>

<p>This form of armouring for an electric cable possesses the qualifications
of pliability, lightness, and great tensile strength. Its weight
in air is 52-106/112 cwt., and in water 28-4/112 cwt. per nautical mile. Its
breaking strain 65 cwt., and cost about £127 per nautical mile.</p>

<p><i>Single Core Unarmoured Cable.</i>&mdash;This form of cable is used in a
system of defence by submarine mines to connect the detached works
of a maritime fortress, &amp;c., for the purpose of telegraphing.</p>

<p>It consists of the ordinary service core, over which are laid two
servings of tarred hemp, put on spirally. The weight of this cable in
air is 4-13/112 cwt., and in water 1-36/112 cwt. per nautical mile; its breaking
strain is 7-1/2 cwt., and its cost per nautical mile is about £35.</p>

<p><i>Special Cables.</i>&mdash;In firing electrical submarine mines by means of
cross bearings, a special cable is employed. As a general rule there
would be three lines of mines placed to converge on one of the stations.</p>

<p>Each of these lines would be provided with a conducting wire in
connection with the firing arrangements, while one line of wire in
connection with the firing station would be required for telegraphing.
For the purpose in question a four cored cable is used.</p>

<p><i>Land Service Cable.</i>&mdash;The cable employed for this service consists of
a core formed similar to that of the multiple cable, described at
<a href="#Page_41">page 41</a>; over which is laid a padding of hemp, and finally two
servings of tarred hemp laid spirally in opposite directions are wound
on. Its weight in air is 16 cwt., and in water 4-50/112 cwt. per nautical
mile. Its breaking strain 17-1/2 cwt., and cost per nautical mile about
£137.</p>

<p><i>Sea Service Cable.</i>&mdash;This consists of a similar core to the land service
cable, and padding of hemp, over which is laid an armouring of fifteen
No. 13 galvanised iron wires, each one being covered with tarred tape,
and finally the ordinary servings of tarred hemp. Its weight in air is
49-101/112 cwt., and in water 25-109/112 cwt. per nautical mile. Its breaking
strain 65-100/112 cwt., and cost per nautical mile about £202.</p>

<p>When frictional electricity is used to fire high tension fuzes, it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
been found by experiment that if several lines of insulated cables are
laid in the same trench for a few hundred yards, the inductive effect of
the electrical charge generated by a frictional machine is so great
that its discharge through one cable is sufficient not only to fire the
fuze in immediate connection with it, but by induction every other fuze
in connection with the remaining wires laid in the trench. And this
effect equally occurs when the electric cables are some feet apart,
provided they run parallel for a few hundred yards, and whether the
shore ends of the cables, the fuzes in connection with which are not
intended to be fired, are insulated, or put directly to earth, the connections
beyond the fuzes being to earth, or even insulated, provided
a very few yards of conductor exist beyond the fuze.</p>

<p>The length of wire which it is necessary to use between the mine
and its circuit closer would be quite sufficient for the purpose of
effecting ignition by induction. With platinum wire fuses there is no
danger whatever of the above happening, nor in the case of high
tension fuzes is there so much danger of ignition by induction, when a
constant instead of a frictional electric battery is used to generate the
current.</p>

<p>Another mode of protecting an insulated cable is to place it, as it
were, in the core of a hempen cable. In forming the rope on the
cable, great care is necessary to prevent any serious amount of torsion,
or tension coming on the insulated wire, either of which would most
assuredly result in injury to the cable. This form of cable might in
connection with obstructions, &amp;c., be of great use, as on account of its
closely resembling an ordinary rope, it would be very unlikely to
excite suspicion, and so would most probably be cut, the result of
which, by previous arrangement, would be an explosion of a mine, or
by means of a galvanometer, &amp;c., an indication that the obstructions,
&amp;c., were being interfered with.</p>

<p><i>Jointing Electrical Cables.</i>&mdash;This is a very important point in connection
with a system of defence or offence by electrical torpedoes. In
many instances it will be found necessary to join either two lengths of
cable, or an insulated wire and a cable, together, in both of which
cases, great care must be used in making the joints, so that the
insulation and the continuity of the circuit may be perfect.</p>

<img src="images/i_070.jpg" width="500" height="788" alt="Plate VIII" /><a id="Plate_VIII"></a>
</div>

<p>Many species of junctions have been from time to time devised, the
most practical and generally employed of which are:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;India rubber tube joint.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;Mathieson's joint.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;Beardslee's joint.</li>
<li>4.&mdash;McEvoy's joint.</li>
<li>5.&mdash;Permanent junction.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>India rubber Tube Joint.</i>&mdash;This form of joint is a very useful one for
extempore purposes, being easily and quickly made, and being very
effective. At <a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a> is shown a sketch of such a junction. About
1·5 inches of the copper conductor of the two insulated cables are laid
bare and connected together by means of Nicoll's metallic joint, as
shown at <a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a>, or by turning one of the conductors round the other,
their ends being carefully pressed down by means of pliers, to prevent
any chance of the india rubber tube being pierced; over the splice
thus formed serve some twine, and over the whole put a coating of
india rubber cement, grease, &amp;c., then draw the vulcanised india rubber
tube, which has been previously placed on one of the insulated cables,
over the splice <i>a</i>, as shown at <i>b</i>, and secure it firmly by means of twine,
<i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, and then to prevent any strain being brought on the joint, form a
half-crown as shown in <a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a> at <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>In forming the splice, it is very important that the metallic ends
should be perfectly clean. The danger to this mode of jointing of
the piercing of the tube by the ends of the conductors is entirely
removed by employing the Nicoll metallic joint, which is formed as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Nicoll Metallic Joint.</i>&mdash;One of the conducting wires, as <i>a</i>, <a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a>, is
formed into a spiral twist by means of a very simple instrument, and
the other wire <i>b</i>, which is left straight, is inserted into the spiral, the
whole being placed on an anvil, and pressed closely and securely
together by a single blow of a hammer.</p>

<p><i>Mathieson's Joint.</i>&mdash;This somewhat complicated, though very effective
mode of jointing, which is adopted in the English torpedo service, is
shown at <a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a>, in elevation and section. It consists of two ebonite
cylinders <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, through which the cables to be connected are passed.
Within these cylinders an ebonite tube <i>b</i>, <i>b</i> is placed, the ends of
which are wedge-shaped, and which press against two vulcanite rings
<i>c</i>, <i>c</i>; in the interior of this tube <i>b</i>, <i>b</i> is the metallic joint <i>d</i> of the two
cables. The centre of the tube <i>b</i>, <i>b</i> is of square section, and fits into a
hollow of similar form in the cylinders <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, the object of this being to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
prevent any twisting of the wires during the process of screwing up,
which would be liable to injure the metallic joint <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>The manner of making this joint will be easily understood from the
figure. With this, as with all other temporary joints, it is advisable
to form a half-crown in the cable, including the joint.</p>

<p><i>Beardslee's Joint.</i>&mdash;This form of temporary joint when used with
strand conductors, which are composed of a number of small wires, has
been found to be exceedingly useful and effective, the only defect of
such a joint being the liability of straightening the wires of the
conductors should a direct strain be brought upon the wire extremities.
<a href="#Fig_38">Fig. 38</a> represents a section of this joint; it consists of an ebonite
cylinder <i>a</i>, one end of which is solid, and the other open and fitted
with a screw thread, into which is screwed a plug <i>b</i>; through both the
plug <i>b</i>, and the solid end of the cylinder <i>a</i>, perforations are made just
large enough to admit the insulated wires <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>; about half an inch of
the extremities of these wires are bared and cleaned, and then passed,
the one through the plug <i>b</i>, a disc of vulcanised india rubber <i>d</i>, and a
metal disc <i>e</i>, and the end of the strand conductor turned back on the
face of this metal disc, the other through the perforation in the solid
end of the cylinder <i>a</i>, then through similar discs <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>, and the end
of the strand conductor treated in the same manner as the former one;
then by means of the screw plug <i>b</i>, the two metallic discs <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, and
consequently the bare extremities of the strand conductors are brought
into close metallic contact.</p>

<p><i>McEvoy's Joint for Iron Wire covered Cable</i>.&mdash;This form of joint
is shown in section at <a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a>. Two brass caps <i>a</i>, <i>a</i> are slipped
over the ends of the cables required to be joined, then the iron wire
and other coverings of the cables down to the insulating substance are
removed, the former being bent back close against the bottom of the
caps <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, as shown in <a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a> at <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>; the cores of the cables are then
joined by an india rubber temporary joint <i>c</i>, which has been described
at <a href="#Page_45">page 45</a>: the whole is then placed in the body of the joint, and
the brass caps <i>a</i>, <i>a</i> screwed up, jamming the bent back iron wires
against a solid piece of brass <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, by which means a firm and perfect
joint is made in the cables.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_40">Fig. 40</a> represents a section of a McEvoy temporary joint for
single cored unarmoured cables, which seems to fulfil all the conditions
necessary to a perfect joint of that description. This joint is, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
exception of there being two screw plugs instead of one, very similar
to Beardslee's joint described at <a href="#Page_46">page 46</a>; this alteration is a great
improvement, remedying as it does the one defect of Beardslee's joint,
viz., the liability of the cables to be drawn apart due to any great tension
being brought on them.</p>

<p>A permanent joint in electrical submarine cables, which from its
nature requires to be an exceptionally good one, is a somewhat difficult
and troublesome operation, and also requires a considerable time to
form a thoroughly reliable one.</p>

<p><i>Siemens's Methods of Jointing.</i>&mdash;The following methods, and instructions
for forming such joints, are those adopted by Messrs. Siemens
Brothers in connection with their telegraph cables, and which will be
found generally applicable to all insulated cables.</p>

<p><i>The Formation of a Joint in the Conductor of an Insulated Cable.</i>&mdash;The
conductor is either covered with a gutta percha or an india rubber
dielectric. In both cases cut off the dielectric so as to bare the conductor-wire
for a length of about three inches, taking care never to cut
at right angles to the conductor-wire, for fear of injuring it with the
cutting-knife or scissors.</p>

<p>Then clean the wires forming the strand with file-card and emery-paper,
and solder them into a solid bar for a length of about one inch.</p>

<p>Having soldered the wires, forming the ends of the two lengths
of conductors to be joined, into two solid rods, file each of them off
in a slanting manner, so that they will form a scarf-joint when put
together.</p>

<p>Place the two ends of strand in the two small vices on a stand
which is supplied for the purpose, so that the two scarfed ends
overlap each other, and bind them round with a piece of fine black
iron wire, in the shape of a spiral, so as to keep the ends close together,
then solder the two ends together by applying a hot soldering iron.</p>

<p>Then remove the iron binding wire and clean up the joint, filing off
all unnecessary solder.</p>

<p>And make a band of four fine tinned copper wires, and bind them
tightly side by side round the joint, covering the whole length of the
scarf, and then solder the band and joint solidly together.</p>

<p>Then make another band of four fine tinned copper wires and bind
them round the joint in the same manner as before, but extending about
a quarter of an inch beyond each end of the other binding wire, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
parts only of this second binding which project beyond the end of the
first binding are to be soldered, so that the centre part remains loose
and may keep up a connection between the two ends by forming a
spiral between them in the event of the scarf giving way and the two
ends of the conductor separating slightly.</p>

<p>This form of joint is called the "spring" joint.</p>

<p>The finished joint should be washed with spirit of wine and
brushed, so as to take away all particles of soldering flux, and to avoid
oxidation of the wire. The washed joint should then be dried with a
piece of cloth and exposed to the flame of a spirit lamp to dry it
thoroughly. A cable conductor ought never to be jointed with the
help of soldering acid, but with that of resin, sal ammoniac, or borax
only, so that any chance oxidation, and consequently destruction,
of the conducting wire may be avoided.</p>

<p>There are other modes of jointing conductors, such as the twisting
and scale joint, but the foregoing method will sufficiently explain this
part of electric cable work.</p>

<p><i>The Formation of a Joint in an India rubber Insulated Cable.</i>&mdash;In
making a joint in any insulated cable, the very greatest care must be
taken to keep the hands, tools, and materials clean and dry.</p>

<p>Remove the felt for about twelve inches from each end of the
core by soaking it with mineral naphtha and then rubbing it off clean
with the file-card. The cleaned surface sear with a red-hot iron, to burn
off all remaining fibres of the felt. Wash these seared ends clean with
naphtha.</p>

<p>Then cut off about four inches of the insulating material (taking
care never to cut at right angles to the conducting wire for fear of
injuring it) so as to leave enough of the conductor bare to join and
solder in the manner described at <a href="#Page_47">page 47</a>.</p>

<p>After the conductor is jointed and soldered, clean again the
seared parts of the insulator with the glazed side of the squares of
cloth moistened with mineral naphtha, so as to leave a clean adhesiveness
only; taper again the insulating material down to the conductor
for about two inches on each side of the conductor-joint with a pair of
curved and very clean scissors.</p>

<p>The tapering must be completed in such slanting way that the
different layers of the dielectric are so far exposed as to enable a secure
laying on of the new jointing material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>India rubber core consists chiefly of three layers of insulating
material: the first layer next to the strand is called the pure or brown;
the second layer is the white or separating; the third layer is the light
red or jacket rubber.</p>

<p>Coat the conductor with a pure (brown) rubber tape tightly laid
on in a spiral form, commencing at the spot where the separator (white)
ends, across the corresponding place on the opposite side of the joint
and back again in a contrary direction. The ends are fastened down
by pressing a clean, heated searing-iron or a heated knife on them.
By doing so the band will stick; the remaining portions of the band
to be cut off with the scissors.</p>

<p>Lay on tightly the separating india rubber tape in the same manner,
but beginning where the jacket or outer layer of rubber ends. One lap
will be sufficient.</p>

<p>Complete the insulation by lapping on tightly two layers of red
india rubber tape: the last lap must cover each end of the core to four
inches on each side of the conductor-joint, or extend to the searing or
tackiness, but not beyond it.</p>

<p>Lay on three tight bindings of the cloth tapes, all in the same
direction, care being taken to avoid wrinkles. The ends of the cloth
tapes are cemented down with a thin coating of india rubber cement.</p>

<p>Immerse the joint in the jointing-bath at 150° to 200° F. and
gradually raise the heat so that in half an hour the temperature will
be 320° F., at which temperature keep the joint for twenty minutes:
then take it out and let it cool in the open air.</p>

<p><i>The Formation of a Joint in a Gutta percha Insulated Cable.</i>&mdash;Having
jointed the conducting wires in the manner described at <a href="#Page_47">page 47</a>,
clean and dry the joint well and cover the bare conductor with a thin
layer of compound. This is best done by heating a small stick of
compound to nearly its melting point, and rubbing it over the bare
conductor, which has been previously heated with the flame of a
spirit-lamp.</p>

<p>Heat the gutta percha covering of both ends gently until it is quite
soft, without, however, causing it to bubble or burn. Draw, then,
with the fingers, the gutta percha coverings of both ends down,
tapering them off until they meet in the middle of the joint; heat
them sufficiently to make them adhere together.</p>

<p>Apply a layer of compound on the tapered-off gutta percha in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
same manner as described for coating the bare conductor, and cover
it with a first coating of gutta percha sheet to about half the thickness
necessary to finish the joint. This is done by heating a small sheet
of gutta percha, of about one-eighth of an inch in thickness, until it
is quite soft, and by pressing it in that state round the joint to the
required size; the greatest care to be taken to expel all the air.</p>

<p>The projecting lips are then cut off with a pair of curved scissors.
The seam thus produced is to be rubbed with a hot iron until it is
completely closed and the joint well rounded off.</p>

<p>Apply another layer of compound and a second layer of gutta
percha in exactly the same manner as described for the first layer;
care, however, is to be taken to get the seam in this second layer of
gutta percha not over, but as nearly as possible right opposite to, the
seam in the layer underneath.</p>

<p>The whole to be worked as cylindrical as possible, and to a size
not exceeding the original core. The joint, so far finished, is then
to be cooled with water until the gutta percha is quite consolidated.</p>

<p>Another, the overlapping gutta percha joint, is made in the
following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>Cut off the two ends of the core, so that the gutta percha and the
conductor-wire are flush. Warm the gutta percha for a distance of
about three inches from each of the ends with the flame of a spirit
lamp, and, when sufficiently soft, push it back until it forms an
enlargement. The two ends of the conductor are then to be soldered
according to instructions for making joint in conductors.</p>

<p>To have a perfectly clean surface of the two gutta percha enlargements,
remove all impurities by the way of peeling them with a sharp
knife. Warm gently both knobs and the copper joint, and cover the
whole length of the bare wire with compound, planing it with a warm
smoothing-iron.</p>

<p>Draw then with the fingers one of the warmed and softened knobs
carefully up to the other knob or enlargement, leaving on its way a
perfect tube of gutta percha upon the wire, decreasing gradually to
the thickness of the copper strand towards the other knob. Any
superfluous gutta percha is removed. This scarf is finished with a
warm smoothing-iron, so as to unite it to the compound on the wire
strand, and a thin layer of compound is also put over the scarf in the
same manner as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The other knob is then warmed and drawn in the same way over
the tube already formed, which is at the same time heated sufficiently
to make the two adhere.</p>

<p>Apply a layer of compound on the second scarf of gutta percha,
covering it in the same manner as described for coating the bare
conductor, and cover it with a small sheet of gutta percha in the
same manner as described above, so as to make the finished joint to
the size of the core as manufactured.</p>

<p><i>Rules to be observed in forming Joints.</i>&mdash;The following rules must
be carefully observed in forming either a temporary or permanent
joint:&mdash;</p>



<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;In laying bare the conductor, the dielectric should be warmed
and then pulled off, so preventing any chance of it being
damaged, which might be the case were the dielectric to be
cut off.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;For a perfect junction, soldering is necessary.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;The wires before connection should be carefully cleaned, and
the hands of those performing the work must be dry.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;Gutta percha should not be given too much heat, for it then
becomes oily and will not, in that state, properly adhere.</div>

<div class='hang2'>5.&mdash;Grease and dirt must be scrupulously avoided.</div>

<p>Great care is absolutely necessary in making junctions, as they
are the principal sources of defect in the insulation of electrical submarine
cables.</p>

<p><i>Junction Boxes.</i>&mdash;When it is necessary to employ a multiple cable,
a junction box is used to facilitate the connection of the several
separate wires diverging from the extremities of such a cable. In
one angle of such a box the multiple cable is introduced, while the
separate cables make their exit on the opposite sides and pass to
the different mines. Different views of a junction box are shown
at <a href="#Fig_41">Fig. 41</a>, where <i>A</i> is a plan of the top or lid, <i>B</i> a plan of the
bottom, with the lid off, <i>C</i> an elevation, and <i>D</i> a section of the box.</p>

<p>The manner of using the junction box is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The multiple cable is put in at <i>a</i>, and secured there by means
of a nipping hook, shown at <a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a>, which hook passes through the
bottom of the junction and is made secure by means of a nut. The
single core cables radiating from the junction box pass through the
openings <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i> on the sides, and angle opposite to where the multiple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
cable a enters. Each multiple cable is composed of seven cores, and
each of these is connected by means of joints with the mine cables
within the junction box, and each of these seven cables is secured
by means of a nipper similar to, but smaller than, the one shown
at <a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a>, which are also secured by means of nuts, as in the case of
the multiple cable nipping hook. When all the connections are made,
the lid <i>A</i> is placed so as to rest on the studs <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, and firmly secured
by a bolt <i>d</i>, which is made water-tight by means of a washer and nut.</p>

<p>By means of the nipping hooks, which take any strain that may
be brought on the cables, the connections within the box are ensured
against injury by such a cause.</p>

<p>To enable the whole to be lifted together for the purposes of
examination of the cables, &amp;c., a buoyed rope is connected to the
eye-bolt <i>e</i>. For this service a dummy circuit closer is the best form
of buoy, it having great buoyancy and resembling in appearance an
active circuit closer.</p>

<p>A junction box should be placed in such a position as to be easily
attained, even in the presence of an enemy, and its buoy should, if
possible, not be seen. It is also very essential that it should be in
a safe and guarded position, for any injury to the junction box or
multiple cable would be fatal to the group of mines in connection.</p>

<p>In the following cases, special junction boxes are used:&mdash;</p>


<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;A seven cored armoured cable to be connected direct to
another length of the same.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;A single armoured cable to be connected as in foregoing
instance.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;A T junction box for the branch system of electrical contact
mines.</div>

<p><i>Junction Box for Multiple Cables.</i>&mdash;At <a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a> is represented a
plan of lower half of this form of junction box. It consists of a pair of
cast iron plates of precisely similar form to the one shown at <a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a>,
and so made as to be capable of being fastened tightly together by
means of four bolts and nuts passing through the holes <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>. The
grooves <i>b</i>, <i>b</i> at the two extremities are just large enough to grip the
armoured cable firmly, when the upper and lower parts are screwed
together. A larger space is provided in the hollow for the joint.</p>

<p><i>Junction Box for Single Cored Cables.</i>&mdash;For this purpose a junction
box similar to, but smaller than the one above described is employed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p><i>T Junction Box.</i>&mdash;This form of junction box is employed when the
system of electrical contact mines on branches from a single cable is
used. This system is dependent on the use of a platinum wire fuze
in connection with a platinum wire bridge in each branch close to its
junction with the main cable.</p>

<p>This form of junction box, which is shown at <a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a> is very
similar to the one used for the connection of two multiple cables, only
differing in its shape, which is that of a T. <i>a</i> is a disconnector, which
will be described further on; <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b'</i> are the armoured electric cables,
<i>b</i>, <i>b</i> being the main, and <i>b'</i> the branch cable in connection with the
forked joint formed within the T junction box; <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i> are Turk's heads
formed to prevent any strain being brought on the forked joint. This
form of Turk's head is made by turning back the wires of the cable
armouring, and frapping them round with spun yarn until the
necessary size and shape is attained.</p>

<p><i>McEvoy's Turk's Head.</i>&mdash;Another form of Turk's head, devised by
Captain McEvoy, is shown at <a href="#Fig_45">Fig. 45</a>. It consists of two separate
pieces of brass, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, the former screwing over the latter. The
mode of using it is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Slip the piece of brass <i>b</i> over the cable <i>c</i>, and turn back the wires
of the cable <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, &amp;c., so that they lie against the shoulder of the brass
piece <i>b</i>, then slip the other piece of brass <i>a</i> over the cable and screw it
on the piece <i>b</i>, firmly jamming the turned back wires <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, &amp;c. This
is a very neat and quick method of forming a Turk's head, and it
should be invariably used in preference to the foregoing method,
which is clumsy, and which takes some time to form.</p>

<p>The section of a disconnector is shown at <a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a>. It consists of
an iron cover, or dome <i>a</i>, which is provided with a screw fitting on to
another screw on the ebonite body <i>b</i> of the apparatus. When the
dome <i>a</i> is screwed tightly down on the washer <i>i</i>, the whole is made
perfectly watertight. <i>c</i>, <i>c</i> are insulated terminals for connecting the
cores of the branch and main cables after their armouring has been
removed, as shown at <a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a>. <i>d</i>, <i>d</i> are two copper conducting wires
(No. 16 B. W. G.) passing through the centre of the ebonite body <i>b</i>,
and projecting into the interior of the apparatus. These wires are
held in position and insulated by means of a composition formed of
a mixture of pitch, tallow, beeswax and gutta percha. This composition
is put on whilst hot and allowed to cool gradually, when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
becomes hard and durable. Great care is necessary to ensure the
cavity within the ebonite body <i>b</i> being completely filled, as otherwise
a leakage might occur, owing to the great pressure of water at depths
where the disconnection would be generally used. <i>f</i> is a boxwood
cover which is slipped on, and fits fairly tight to the ebonite body <i>b</i>;
<i>g</i> is a piece of thin platinum wire, weighing 1·6 grains to the yard,
and being 4/10 inch in length; <i>h</i> is an ebonite pin, which passes
through two small holes in the boxwood cover <i>f</i>, into which it fits
tightly, and in such a position as to be directly beneath the platinum
wire bridge <i>g</i>, when the boxwood cover <i>f</i> is fixed on. The pin <i>h</i> is
pushed through the holes in the cover <i>f</i> from the outside, so as to pass
beneath the bridge <i>g</i> after the priming has been inserted, and the
cover has been placed on.</p>

<p>When prepared for use, the platinum wire bridge <i>g</i> is surrounded
by some loose gun-cotton priming, sufficient in quantity to blow off the
boxwood cover <i>f</i>, without destroying the dome <i>a</i>; the cover <i>f</i> being
blown off, carries the ebonite pin <i>h</i> with it, and through the platinum
wire bridge <i>g</i>, thereby rupturing it, and breaking the continuity of the
circuit. The object of so doing is to cut off the connection of an
exploded mine, so that the full amount of the firing current is available
for the other mines, and not suffered to be wasted by passing through
the exposed wire of the broken circuit, which, were the disconnector
not employed, would be the case.</p>

<p>When any particular mine of a system is struck, the current passes
through the main cable <i>b</i>, the disconnector <i>a</i> (which is in connection
with that mine), and branch cable <i>b'</i> to the fuze, and so explodes the
mine, and destroys the platinum wire bridge <i>g</i> of the disconnector at
practically the same instant. The effect of the latter operation would
be to cut off and insulate the branch cable of the exploded mine, and
so prevent any loss of the electrical current, when another mine of
that system is required to be fired.</p>

<p>The platinum wire bridge <i>g</i> is 4/10 inch long, while that of the
fuze is 3/10 inch, the object of this difference in length of the bridges
being to ensure the former one <i>g</i> being fired, and thus the insulation
made doubly sure. Many other forms of disconnectors have been
devised, but none have proved in practice so effective as the one just
described.</p>

<p><i>Mooring Electrical Submarine Mines.</i>&mdash;This is one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
difficult problems to be solved in connection with a system of submarine
mines. The objects to be attained in mooring are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;The mines should preserve the exact positions in which they
are laid down.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;From the comparatively small radius of destructive effect,
of even heavily charged submarine mines, it will be understood how
absolutely essential, in the case of mines fired by judgment, it is that
this object should be attained.</p>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;The mooring chains, or ropes, must be so arranged that no
twisting whatever should occur, as otherwise fracture of the
insulated wire would be likely to happen.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;In the case of buoyant mines, their distance from the bottom
must be so adjusted, that at no time shall a vessel passing
over them be out of their vertical range of destruction, nor
shall they be visible.</div>

<p>The difficulties attendant upon the efficient mooring of submarine
mines are immense, as will be understood when the action of gales of
wind, and strong tides, which latter vary continually in their direction
and in their rise and fall, are taken into consideration.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks apply more particularly to a system of
buoyant submarine mines, as those placed on the ground are comparatively
easy to moor.</p>

<p>Several modes of mooring buoyant submarine mines have been
suggested, the most practicable of which are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;Ladder moorings.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;Fore and aft moorings.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;Austrian method of mooring.</li>
<li>4.&mdash;Single rope mooring.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Ladder Mooring.</i>&mdash;This is a method of mooring, which in places where
it may be necessary to place the anchors far apart will be found useful.</p>

<p>The circuit closer is connected to the mine by two ropes which
lead thence to two anchors, the ropes being separated by wooden
rounds, or spreaders, 1 to 3 feet long, by which the tendency to
twisting is prevented.</p>

<p>The anchors are placed some 12 feet apart.</p>

<p>The only defect of the ladder mooring is the quantity of sea-weed,
&amp;c., that is liable to be lodged on the rounds, thus causing the circuit
closer to be drawn out of its proper position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fore and aft Mooring.</i>&mdash;This mode may be advantageously employed
in a tideway where the current runs very strong, that is to say, five
knots per hour, or more. It consists simply of two anchors, one of
which is moored up, and the other down the stream.</p>

<p><i>Austrian Method of Mooring.</i>&mdash;This method of mooring, adopted by
the Austrians during the war of 1866, is shown at <a href="#Fig_47">Fig. 47</a>. It consists
of a wooden triangular platform on which several heavy weights <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>
are placed; the mine is attached to this platform by means of three
wire ropes <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, connected to the angles of the latter, and fastened
to three chains, which by means of a catch holds the mine at the
position required.</p>

<p>This catch consists of a pulley attached to the extremity of the
wire rope of the platform, through which the mooring chain of the
mine is passed, and fastened by a key at the required depth by means
of a self-acting arrangement.</p>

<p>This key, which is of considerable weight, slips down as the mine
is being hauled into position, but the moment the chain is slacked,
two arms catch into a link of the chain, and so hold the mine in
position. The weight of such a key is about 60 lbs. It is fitted with
nuts, &amp;c., to enable it to be taken to pieces.</p>

<p>This plan of mooring proved very effective in the harbours of the
Adriatic, where there is hardly any tide or current to twist the mooring
ropes, or otherwise disturb the mines. The Austrians have lately
adopted the mushroom sinker in place of the wooden platform and
weights, for their anchor.</p>

<p><i>Single Rope Mooring.</i>&mdash;This simple method of mooring has after
numerous exhaustive experiments been adopted as the most practicable
and effective of all others. Whenever possible, a wire instead of
hempen cable should be used to connect the mine and its circuit
closer to the mooring anchor, as the former is less liable to twist,
kink, or wear from friction than the latter.</p>

<p>A ground mine with circuit closer attached is represented at <a href="#Fig_48">Fig.
48</a>, where <i>a</i> is the wire mooring rope, <i>b</i> the electric cable leading from
the mine to the circuit closer, <i>C</i>, and <i>c</i> the cable leading from the
firing station to the mine; <i>d</i> is the oblong sinker attached to the mine,
and <i>e</i> the tripping chain leading to the shore, to which the cable <i>c</i>
is attached at intervals, so that by underrunning the electric cable, the
tripping chain may be easily picked up, and the mine raised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>At <a href="#Fig_49">Fig. 49</a> is shown a buoyant mine. The only difference in the
mooring of this and the one before described, is that instead of resting
on its anchor on the ground, it is moored at a certain distance above
its anchor <i>d</i>, to which it is secured by a chain <i>e</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_50">Fig. 50</a> represents an electro contact mine. <i>M</i> is the mine with
circuit closer enclosed, <i>a</i> the wire mooring rope, <i>d</i> the mushroom
anchor, and <i>b</i> the electric cable leading from the mine to the disconnector
<i>D</i>.</p>

<p>The mushroom sinker or anchor, which is undoubtedly the most
effective of all other forms of mooring anchors used for the purposes of
anchoring submarine mines, is shown at <i>e</i>, Fig. 49; the legs are added
for use on rocky or hard bottoms, under which circumstances the
weight of the anchor should also be increased.</p>

<p>For ground mines the form of sinker shown at <i>d</i>, <a href="#Fig_48">Fig. 48</a> is
employed; it is of an oblong shape, and hollowed out in the centre to
allow of its being lashed close up to the mine.</p>

<p>Large blocks of stones with their bases slightly hollowed are useful
as extempore moorings, so also is the one shown at <a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a>,
which consists of a strong heavy wooden shaft <i>a</i>, with a number of
wooden arms <i>b</i>, <i>b</i> attached to its base; this form of extempore sinker
was considered very efficient by the American authorities.</p>

<p>The wooden weighted platform, which was described at <a href="#Page_56">page 56</a>,
is also a very useful form of extempore sinker.</p>

<p>For dead weight moorings, pigs of ballast, heavy stones, &amp;c., may
be used.</p>

<p>The weight of the anchor or sinker for mooring submarine mines is
a very important consideration. It will depend on the amount of buoyancy
of the mine, on the strength of current, and on the nature of the
bottom, also whether the mines are to be hauled down to, or moored
with the anchor.</p>

<p>Stotherd uses the following formula:</p>

<div class='center'>
W = 2&radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">B<sup>2</sup> + P<sup>2</sup></span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>where B is the excess of the flotation over the weight of the charge of
a given submarine mine;</div>

<p>P is the pressure exerted by any given current on the same
buoyant mine;</p>

<p>W the weight of sinker necessary to overcome the tendency of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
mine to move. In still water P becomes nothing, and therefore W
equal to 2 B, that is, in still water double the buoyancy of a mine is a
sufficient weight for its anchor.</p>

<p>The value of P may be found from the formula P = 4·085 × V<sup>2</sup>,
where V is the velocity of the current in miles per hour.</p>

<p>From this equation P will be found in terms of pressure in pounds
per square foot of flat surface, which is nearly double that on the
curved surface of a cylinder.</p>

<p>In regard to the amount of buoyancy of a submarine mine, it has
been found by actual practice that in the case of a mine moored in
still water it should certainly be not less than the weight of the charge,
whilst if subjected to the lateral pressure due to a current, it should
be not less than three times the pressure exerted by the current.</p>

<p>It is always necessary to allow an excess of buoyancy over the
calculated amount to counteract any leakage, or other disturbing
cause which might otherwise materially affect the efficiency of
the mine.</p>

<p>There are two modes of placing a mine in position; either by
attaching the anchor, with the cable necessary for the depth of water,
to the mine, and lowering both together, or by placing the anchor first,
and then hauling the mine down to it, and by means of a catch, fastening
it at the required depth.</p>

<p>The first mode is exceedingly simple, but except under very
favourable circumstances cannot be relied on when firing by observation
is the means adopted to explode a system of submarine mines. The
second plan is practically easy to carry out, and by it a mine may be
placed more accurately. To enable either of the above methods to be
properly carried out, specially fitted steamboats, &amp;c., are requisite.</p>

<p>At <a href="#Fig_52">Fig. 52</a> is represented a 42 feet launch fitted for laying down a
submarine mine by the first of the two modes enumerated above.</p>

<p><i>a</i> is the mine; <i>b</i> is the electric cable carried from the drum <i>c</i> to the
charge, and connected for use; <i>d</i> is the circuit closer, which is attached
to the mine by its electric cable and mooring rope; <i>f</i> is the mushroom
sinker attached by means of its mooring chain to the mine, it is
suspended by a slip rope <i>g</i>, which passes over a small crutch fitted with
a sheave <i>h</i>; <i>i</i> is a hollow iron derrick, and <i>k</i> the tackle and fall for
lifting mine into boat; this derrick is formed of an iron tube about 3
inches diameter, 3/8 inch thick, and 10 feet 6 inches long; it is attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to an iron tube mast of similar diameter and thickness to the derrick,
but 12 feet 3 inches long, an iron chain 6 feet 6 inches long and 5/8 inch
diameter, connects the derrick to the mast; <i>m</i> is a leading sheave to
keep the cable clear whilst it is being paid out; <i>l</i> is a crab, for working
the tackle <i>k</i>, &amp;c., and <i>c</i> is the drum on which the electric cable is wound.</p>

<p>In connection with the defence of a harbour by a system of
electrical submarine mines of large size, it will be necessary to employ
a service of steamtugs, steamboats, mooring-barges, &amp;c., specially
fitted for such work. One of the great advantages of the hauling
down method of placing mines in position, is, that the anchors, with the
cables connected thereto, may be carefully and accurately got into
position during the time of peace, and the mines themselves, which
should be kept in store ready fitted for immediate use, need not be
placed in position until they are actually required. The drums used
for reeling a multiple cable on, are capable of holding half a nautical
mile in length. That used for a single core armoured cable is similar
to but smaller than the aforesaid drum, and is capable of stowing one
nautical mile of such a cable. For transportation wooden drums are
ordinarily used.</p>

<small>DEFENSIVE TORPEDO WARFARE&mdash;<i>continued</i>.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'><i>CLOSING the Electric Circuit.</i>&mdash;In connection with the system of
coast defence by means of electrical submarine mines, there are two
distinct methods of effecting the closing of the electric circuit, and
consequently, the firing battery being connected, the explosion of the
mine or mines, which methods may be used separately, or in combination,
and are as follows:&mdash;</div>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;The self-acting method.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;The firing by judgment, or observation method.</li>
</ul>

<p>During the early days of submarine defensive warfare, the latter
method alone was used, owing to the absence of anything like a
practicable form of self-acting apparatus; but within the last few
years, the former has almost entirely superseded the latter method,
except in very exceptional cases; this revolution being due to the vast
improvements that have been, and still are being effected in the
system of firing electrical submarine mines automatically.</p>

<p><i>Use of Circuit Closers.</i>&mdash;Electrical submarine mines may by means
of an apparatus, termed a <i>circuit closer</i>, be rendered self-acting; that is
to say, by the action of a vessel coming in contact with such an
apparatus, which may be either within the mine itself, or within a
buoy attached to the mine, the electric circuit is closed, and the mine
in connection with the circuit closer so struck, exploded. The essential
feature of such a mode of closing the electric circuit is, that electrical
submarine mines may be rendered either active or harmless, at the
will of the operator, which is effected by the putting in, or taking out
of a plug, by which means the firing current is either thrown in, or out
of the circuit.</p>

<p><i>Circuit closers.</i>&mdash;Many different forms of circuit closers have been
devised, among which the following seem the most suitable and are
those generally used:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;Mathieson's inertia circuit closer.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;Mathieson's spiral spring circuit closer.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;Austrian self-acting circuit closer.</li>
<li>4.&mdash;McEvoy's mercury circuit closer.</li>
<li>5.&mdash;McEvoy's weight magneto circuit closer.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Mathieson's Circuit Closer.</i>&mdash;This form of circuit closer has been
adopted by the English government in connection with their system
of defence by electrical submarine mines.</p>

<p>The details of this apparatus are shown at Pl. xiii.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_53">Fig. 53</a>, <i>a</i> is a gun-metal dome screwed on to a metal base <i>b</i>, its
foot resting on a gutta percha washer <i>c</i>, so as to exclude any water;
<i>d</i> is a cap screwed on to the top of the dome, and made watertight
by the leather washer <i>e</i>; <i>f</i> is a guard cap screwed into the cap <i>d</i>, this
is to keep the spindle of the circuit closer steady during transport, and
would be removed when the apparatus is prepared for service; <i>g</i> is the
ebonite base plug through which pass the insulated wires <i>E</i> and <i>L</i>;
<i>h</i> is an hexagonal collar, working in the metal base plate <i>b</i>, by means
of which, and the brass collar <i>i</i>, and the leather washer <i>k</i>, the base plug
is secured, and water is excluded from the interior of the circuit closer;
<i>l</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>l</i> are brass columns supporting a circular ebonite piece <i>m</i>; <i>n</i> is a
metal bridge screwed on to the base plate <i>b</i>, into which is screwed the
spindle <i>p</i>, both of which are prevented from moving after being
screwed up by the set screws <i>r</i> and <i>s</i>.</p>

<p>The spindle <i>p</i> carries a leaden ball <i>t</i>, which is supported upon the
rest <i>v</i>, and is secured in position by the screw nut <i>w</i>; <i>x</i> is an india
rubber ring, the object of which is to prevent any damage being done
to the spindle should the ball when set in action by a heavy blow from
a passing vessel be brought into contact with the dome; 2 is a brass
disc attached to the spindle carrying an ebonite disc 4, connected to it
by screws; 6 is a brass contact ring also fixed to the ebonite disc 4, provided
with a screw 8, for the attachment of one of the base plug wires,
and with platinised projections 3, 3, 3, <a href="#Fig_56">Fig. 56</a>. The contact ring 6
is completely insulated from the spindle and brass disc 2. Three contact
springs 5, are attached to the circular ebonite piece <i>m</i>, and the faces
opposite to the platinised projections of the disc 2 are also platinised.
7 shows the contact screws of the connecting pieces, which serve also
as adjusting screws to regulate the sensitiveness of the apparatus, the
points of which as well as their bearings on the springs are platinised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The springs are connected together by means of the wires 9,
<a href="#Fig_55">Fig. 55</a>, one end of which is secured to the connecting piece by the
screw 10, and the other passes through to the top of the ebonite piece,
and is attached to the top of the spring next in succession to that to
which it is fixed below.</p>

<p>One terminal of a coil of 1000 ohms resistance (which is used for
testing purposes) is attached to the line <i>L</i>, terminal of the ebonite
base plug, which latter is also connected to the screw 8, on the circumference
of the contact ring 6; the other terminal of the resistance
coil is connected to the earth, <i>E</i> terminal of the base plug.</p>

<p>A bare copper wire of No. 16 B. W. G. connects the top of the last
contact spring with the set screw <i>s</i>; a piece of similar wire jointed to
it is passed round one of the brass collars and connected to the screw <i>r</i>.
As a precaution against bad contact, the contact springs are connected
together by bare wires <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>. This completes the connections for the
signalling circuit, the earth being formed by the body of the instrument;
<i>D</i> is a hole left in the metal base for the passage of the insulating
wire which connects the earth plate to the earth <i>E</i> terminal of the
base plug.</p>

<p><i>Testing Current.</i>&mdash;For testing purposes the current from the test
battery arrives by the line wire <i>L</i>, and passes thence through the
resistance coil to earth by means of the wire <i>E</i>, which is attached to a
zinc earth plate placed in a recess in the jacket of the circuit closer.</p>

<p><i>Action of the Circuit.</i>&mdash;The action of the apparatus is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Closer.</i>&mdash;On the circuit closer being struck, the weight of the lead
ball <i>t</i> causes the steel rod <i>p</i> to be deflected and brings the brass ring 6
in contact with one of the springs 5; the signalling current which up
to this moment has been passing through the 1000 ohms coil to earth,
then passes to the contact ring 6 (avoiding the resistance coil) thence
to the spring which is in contact with it, and from there by means of
the wire connections to the set screws <i>s</i> and <i>r</i>, and so to earth through
the metal body of the apparatus; the effect of the resistance coil
being thus eliminated, is to strengthen the signalling current, and
thus enable it to work the shutter apparatus, by which means the firing
current is thrown into circuit and the mine exploded.</p>

<img src="images/i_098.jpg" width="500" height="798" alt="Plate XIII" /><a id="Plate_XIII"></a>
</div>

<p><i>Circuit Breaker.</i>&mdash;By altering the mode of connecting the wires, the
above apparatus may be used as a circuit breaker, that is to say, the
signal may be given, and the mine exploded by the cessation of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
passing current, instead of by the closing of the electric circuit. This
system was specially designed for use with platinum wire fuzes, but is
rarely used.</p>

<p><i>Circuit Closer of Electro Contact Mines.</i>&mdash;When the inertia circuit
closer is employed in connection with electro contact mines, the
circular ebonite piece <i>m</i> is replaced by a similar shaped piece of brass,
and which is in metallic connection through the brass pillars <i>l</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>l</i>
with the mass of the metal of the apparatus which forms the earth
plate.</p>

<p>The insulated wire of the base plug is connected to one pole of a
platinum wire fuze, the other pole of which is connected by another
wire to the outer metal rim of the disc of the spindle. As long as the
circuit closer remains undisturbed, a break will remain in the circuit,
which is due to the ebonite insulation between the spindle and the
outer metal rim of the disc; but the moment the apparatus is struck,
which causes the spindle to vibrate, the outer metal rim will come in
contact with one of the springs completing the circuit, through the
circular metal portion and the pillars of the circuit closer to earth.</p>

<p><i>Adjustment of Circuit Closer.</i>&mdash;The sensitiveness of Mathieson's inertia
circuit closer is determined by the distance between the disc 4 and
the springs 5, 5, 5, which is regulated by means of the adjusting screws
7, 7, 7, which press against the inner faces of the springs. Owing to
the great weight of the leaden ball, when by any cause the circuit
closer is inclined for a length of time, a permanent set is given to the
spindle, thereby destroying the adjustment of the instrument.</p>

<p><i>Improvements in the Inertia Circuit Closer.</i>&mdash;To remedy this very
serious defect, a cylinder of india rubber is substituted for the leaden
ball; a circuit closer so fitted is also less affected by the action of
counter mines, which is a very important advantage.</p>

<p><i>Mathieson's Spiral Spring Circuit Closer.</i>&mdash;A sectional elevation of
this form of circuit closer is shown at <a href="#Fig_57">Fig. 57</a>. It consists of a brass
base <i>a</i>, provided with a grooved flange for carrying a gutta percha
washer, and it has also an hexagonal projection for the purpose of
screwing the circuit closer into the gun-metal mouth of its air-tight
cylinder, or buoy; <i>b</i> is a brass dome enclosing the apparatus for the
purpose of protecting it from injury, and also by means of india rubber
washers to prevent an ingress of water, should the circuit closer case
become injured, and leak; <i>c</i> is a brass collar to which the brass contact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
springs <i>i</i>, <i>i</i> are attached, and which are regulated by the set screws
<i>j</i>, <i>j</i>; a brass spiral spring <i>d</i> carries a metal rod <i>e</i>, which supports a
brass ball <i>f</i>, surrounded by an india rubber band <i>h</i>. A contact disc <i>g</i>
is secured to the base of the spindle <i>e</i>, but insulated from it by an
ebonite boss; <i>k</i> is an ebonite base plug with two channels in it,
through which the wires <i>m</i>, <i>m<sup>1</sup></i> pass.</p>

<p><i>An Improvement on the Inertia Circuit Closer.</i>&mdash;This instrument is a
vast improvement on the inertia apparatus previously described, being
more simple and more certain in its action, a desideratum in all
circuit closers; but notwithstanding, up to the present time Mathieson's
inertia apparatus has been used by our government, to the exclusion
of all other instruments of a similar nature, some of which were proved
to be far superior when subjected to the crucial test of actual practice.</p>

<p><i>Austrian Self-acting Circuit Closer.</i>&mdash;This form of circuit closing
apparatus, which is purely a self-acting one, that is to say, a mine so
fitted cannot be fired at will, is shown at <a href="#Fig_58">Fig. 58</a>.</p>

<p>It consists of several buffers <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, which by means of strong
springs are held in position, their heads projecting outside the torpedo
case <i>b</i>; on being pressed in by the contact of a passing vessel, the
ends of these buffers would be forced against a ratchet wheel <i>c</i>, which
is also kept in position by means of a spring. Several strong pieces
of wood <i>d</i>, <i>d</i> within the case keep the buffers and their attached arms
in the proper direction, and also afford rigidity to the torpedo case.
The brass ratchet wheel <i>c</i> being put in motion carries round with it a
central arrangement <i>e</i>, the lower part of which is shown at <a href="#Fig_58">Fig. 58</a>, <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>This portion consists of a cylinder of brass <i>f</i> divided into two parts
insulated one from the other by a piece of ebonite <i>g</i>; on one side of
this cylinder there are three arms of brass, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, and <i>k</i>, and on the other
there are two arms, <i>l</i> and <i>m</i>, all of which are insulated from each other.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a id="Fig_59"></a><a id="Fig_58"></a><a id="Fig_57"></a>
<div class="caption">AUSTRIAN CIRCUIT CLOSER, MERCURY CIRCUIT CLOSER.</div>
<img src="images/i_102.jpg" width="500" height="791" alt="Plate XIV" /><a id="Plate_XIV"></a>
</div>

<p>The arm <i>h</i> is close to, but insulated from a metal plate <i>n</i>, which
latter is permanently connected with the conducting wire leading
from the firing battery, and thus while in a state of rest is electrically
charged; beyond the arm <i>i</i> is a spring <i>o</i>, which is connected with
the earth, and in such a position that when the central portion is
moved round, this spring <i>o</i> comes in contact with the arm <i>i</i>, and
the plate <i>n</i> with the arm <i>h</i> simultaneously, and the circuit is thus
completed through earth to the battery, but the current of electricity
does not pass through the fuze. The arms <i>k</i>, <i>l</i> on the opposite sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of the cylinder, and consequently insulated one from the other, are
connected with the fuze, and the arm <i>m</i> is connected with the earth.</p>

<p>On a further pressure of the vessel on the buffer, the arm <i>i</i> is
pushed beyond the spring, and in contact therewith, and consequently
the circuit by earth to the battery is broken, while the contact of the
arm <i>h</i> and plate <i>n</i> is still retained, and the current is passed by the
arm <i>k</i> through the fuze to the arm <i>l</i>, and then to earth through the
arm <i>m</i>, thus completing the electric circuit of the firing battery
through the fuze, and to exploding the mine.</p>

<p>The spring acts as a circuit breaker, and by means of an intensity
coil in connection with the firing battery, the current is only passed
through the fuze when at the point of greatest intensity.</p>

<p>By detaching the firing battery, the channel defended by such
submarine mines may be rendered safe.</p>

<p><i>Fuze only in Circuit at Moment of Firing it.</i>&mdash;One of the principal
objects to be gained by the employment of such an arrangement for
the closing of the electric circuit in connection with submarine mines,
is the prevention of premature explosion from induction which might
be caused by the proximity of any atmospheric electricity, the fuze
in this system being entirely cut out of circuit until the moment
when it is necessary to fire it.</p>

<p>The Austrians employed this form of circuit closing instrument
during the war of 1866, and still continue to use it in connection with
their coast defence by submarine mines.</p>

<p><i>McEvoy's Mercury Circuit Closer.</i>&mdash;At <a href="#Fig_59">Fig. 59</a> is represented a
longitudinal section of a circuit closer of this construction.</p>

<p>It is placed in the mine in such a manner that when undisturbed
it maintains an approximately upright position.</p>

<p>It consists of a metal tube <i>a</i> into which the cup <i>b</i> of vulcanite, or
other insulating material is fixed. The cup is contracted at some
distance from the top by the perforated plug <i>c</i>, which is also of
insulating material; <i>d</i> is a metal pin fixed into the bottom of the
cup <i>b</i>, it is connected with the wire <i>e</i>, which is insulated and passes
to the battery; <i>f</i> is a metal plug closing the tube <i>a</i> and the cup <i>b</i> at
the top; <i>g</i> is a wire attached to the plug <i>f</i>, and passing from it to an
earth connection. The cup <i>b</i> is filled with mercury up to the level of
the plug <i>c</i>. By the contact of a passing vessel the instrument would
be tilted sufficiently to cause the mercury to flow into contact with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the metal plug <i>f</i>, thus completing the electric circuit and exploding
the mine.</p>

<p>This form of circuit closer, though not generally adopted, would, on
account of its being less liable to derangement by the motion of the
waves, or by the explosion of an adjacent or counter mine, seem to fulfil
the many requirements of a circuit closer for general service.</p>

<p><i>McEvoy's Weight Magneto Circuit Closer.</i>&mdash;This form of circuit closer,
which is shown in section and plan at <a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a> and <a href="#Fig_61">61</a>, is one of the
most important improvements that has ever been effected in such
apparatus, and bids fair to become universally adopted.</p>

<p>A heavy metal conical shaped weight <i>a</i> (Fig. 60), hollowed out in
its base and working in a ball and socket joint <i>b</i>, rests on a solid brass
base <i>c</i>, and is so arranged that on the apparatus being struck, the
weight <i>a</i> will fall over, pivoting on one of its supports <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>; <i>e</i> is a band
of india rubber, encircling the weight <i>a</i>, for the purpose of preventing
a jar on its falling against the sides of the brass cylinder <i>f</i>, which
contains the weight <i>a</i> and joint <i>b</i>. A brass rod <i>g</i>, connected to the ball
and socket joint, passes through the base <i>c</i>, through a strong spiral
spring <i>h</i> (which latter rests on an adjusting screw <i>k</i>), through a piece
of ebonite <i>l</i>, which supports the bobbins and core <i>m</i>, <i>m</i><sup>1</sup>; then between
these bobbins <i>m</i>, <i>m</i><sup>1</sup> through an armature <i>n</i>, which is pivoted at <i>p</i>;
and lastly through a slight spiral spring <i>o</i>, which is kept in position by
the adjusting screw <i>i</i>.</p>

<p>The armature <i>n</i> is fitted with a small piece of brass <i>r</i>, so arranged
that when it (the armature) is in the position shown in <a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a>, this
piece of brass <i>r</i> does not make contact with the two strips of metal, <i>s</i>, <i>s</i>,
between which it, <i>r</i>, works; but when the armature <i>n</i> is in contact
with the cores of the bobbins <i>m</i>, <i>m</i><sup>1</sup>, then the piece of brass <i>r</i> makes
contact with the metal strips <i>s</i> <i>s</i>, and so makes a short circuit for the
electric current. An ordinary telephone <i>t</i>, <a href="#Fig_61">Fig. 61</a>, in which some
small shot, bells, &amp;c., are placed, is fixed to the top of the brass
cylinder <i>f</i>.</p>

<p><i>Action of Circuit Closer.</i>&mdash;The action of this apparatus is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the mine carrying this form of circuit closer being struck by a
passing vessel, the weight <i>a</i> is caused to fall over towards the side of the
brass cylinder <i>f</i>, thus allowing the strong spiral spring <i>h</i> to act on the
brass rod <i>g</i> in an upward direction, by which means the armature <i>n</i> is
brought into contact with the soft iron cores of the bobbins <i>m</i>, <i>m</i><sup>1</sup>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a id="Fig_61"></a><a id="Fig_60"></a>
<div class="caption">M<sup>c.</sup>EVOY'S MAGNETO ELECTRO CIRCUIT CLOSER.</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The connections of the wires are made as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The line wire <i>w</i> is led through the base of the apparatus and
connected to a piece of brass under the ebonite support <i>l</i>, in connection
with one of the wires of the bobbin <i>m</i>, the other wire of which is
attached to the metal strip <i>s</i>; the wires of the bobbin <i>m</i><sup>1</sup> are connected,
the one to the metal strip <i>s</i><sub>1</sub>, the other to a piece of brass under the
ebonite support <i>l</i>; from this latter piece of brass a wire <i>w</i><sub>1</sub> is led to
the brass screw <i>x</i>. The wires <i>w</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>w</i><sub>3</sub>, from the fuzes are led, the one to
the brass screw <i>x</i>, the other to a screw <i>y</i>, which forms through the metal
of the apparatus the earth plate. One of the wires of the telephone <i>t</i>
is connected to the brass screw <i>x</i>, the other <i>w</i><sub>4</sub> is connected to the
piece of brass to which the line wire <i>w</i> is also attached. While the
circuit closer remains in a state of rest, the current from the signalling
battery flows along the line wire <i>w</i>, up the telephone wire <i>w</i><sub>4</sub>, through
the telephone which has a high resistance, then by the wire <i>w</i><sub>2</sub> through
the fuzes, and to earth by the wire <i>w</i><sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>On the circuit closer being struck, by which cause the armature <i>n</i>
is brought up to the cores of the bobbins <i>m</i>, <i>m</i><sup>1</sup>, and the piece of brass <i>r</i>
in contact with the metal strips <i>s</i>, <i>s</i><sub>1</sub>, the signalling current, instead of
circulating through the high resistance of the telephone <i>t</i>, passes round
the bobbin <i>m</i>, down the metal strip <i>s</i>, across the brass piece <i>r</i>, up the
metal strip <i>s</i><sub>1</sub>, round the bobbin <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> (thus forming an electro magnet of
<i>m</i>, <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>), and by the wire <i>w</i>, direct through the fuzes to earth, and so
explodes the torpedo. The effect of the telephone resistance being cut
out, is to strengthen the signalling current, and enable it to work the
shutter apparatus and so throw the firing battery in circuit and
explode the mine.</p>

<p>The advantages of this circuit closing apparatus are:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;Simplicity.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;Compactness.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;Increased certainty of action, due to the sustained contact of
the armature <i>n</i>, on the apparatus being struck.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;Additional means of testing a system of electrical submarine
mines, which is afforded by the telephone:&mdash;</div>

<p>When this form of circuit closer is put in action by a friendly vessel
coming in contact with it, or when experiments are being made, the
signalling current must be reversed, so that no doubt may exist as to
the armature <i>n</i> having dropped, on the apparatus coming to rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The telephone test indicates whether the circuit closer is in position
or not, the shot, &amp;c., within the telephone being shaken about by the
movement of the buoyant circuit closer, the noise so created is readily
distinguished by the receiving telephone at the station.</p>

<p>Another form of submarine mine is that known as the "Electro
Mechanical" mine. The difference between this form and an ordinary
mechanical mine is, that the exploding agent is electricity, and that
it may be converted into an electro contact mine if desirable.</p>

<p><i>Description of a Russian Electro.</i>&mdash;The electro mechanical mine, used
by the Russians during the late Turco-Russian war, is shown in
elevation and section at <a href="#Fig_62">Fig. 62</a> and <a href="#Fig_63">63</a>.</p>

<p><i>Mechanical Submarine Mine, used by them during the late Turco-Russian
War.</i>&mdash;<i>A</i> is the conical shaped case; <i>B</i> the loading hole; <i>C</i> the base
plug; <i>D</i>, <i>D</i>, &amp;c., are five horns, screwed into the head of the case <i>A</i>;
these are composed of a glass tube <i>A</i>, containing a chlorate of potash
mixture, enclosed in a lead tube <i>B</i>, over which is screwed a brass
safety cylinder <i>C</i>; when ready for action this latter tube <i>C</i> is removed;
directly beneath each of the horns <i>A</i>, on the inside of the case, as at
<i>E</i>, is a thin brass cylinder, closed at one end by a piece of wood <i>d</i>,
and containing several pieces of zinc and carbon, arranged in the form
of a battery, the zinc and carbon wires <i>z</i> and <i>x</i> being led through the
piece of wood <i>d</i>; <i>F</i> is a copper cylinder containing the priming charge
of gun-cotton <i>g</i>, and detonating fuse <i>f</i>; the terminals of the fuze are
connected to two insulated wires, <i>w</i> and <i>w</i><sub>1</sub>, the former of which is led
direct to the loading hole <i>B</i>, and attached on the inside to the five zinc
connecting wires <i>z</i>, &amp;c.; the latter is attached to one end of a safety
arrangement <i>S</i>, the other end of which is connected to the wire <i>w</i><sub>2</sub>,
which is attached on the inside to the carbon wires <i>x</i>, &amp;c.; the safety
arrangement <i>S</i> consists of an ebonite cylinder, containing a brass
spiral spring fixed to one end of it, and pressing against a brass plate
at the other, thus preserving a metallic connection between the wires <i>w</i><sub>1</sub>,
and <i>w</i><sub>2</sub>; the mine is rendered inactive by pressing the spring down,
and inserting a piece of ebonite between it and the plate.</p>

<p><i>Its Action.</i>&mdash;The action of this form of electro mechanical submarine
mine is very simple; the brass safety cylinders <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, &amp;c., being
removed on a vessel striking either of the horns, <i>D</i>, <i>D</i>, &amp;c., the lead
tube <i>b</i> is bent, causing the glass tube <i>a</i> to be broken, and the mixture
contained therein to flow into the cylinder <i>E</i>, instantly generating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
a current of electricity in the zinc carbon battery, and exploding
the mine.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Converting into an Electro Contact or Observation Mine.</i>&mdash;To
convert this mine into an electro contact one, it is only necessary
to connect the wires <i>w</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>w</i><sub>2</sub> to other wires leading from the shore;
also by replacing the horns <i>D</i>, <i>D</i> by solid brass screw plugs, the mine
may be converted into an ordinary observation one. In this case the two
wires <i>w</i> and <i>w</i><sub>1</sub> attached to the fuze <i>f</i>, terminals would have to be
connected to the observation instruments on shore.</p>

<p><i>Turkish Vessel sunk.</i>&mdash;It was by means of one of these electro
mechanical mines, that the Turkish gunboat <i>Suna</i> was sunk at Soulina.</p>

<p>Firing by observation, that is to say, effecting the ignition of an
electrical submarine mine at the precise moment of a hostile vessel
being vertically over it, through the agency of one or two observers
stationed at a very considerable distance from the mine, should, with
the very perfect self-acting circuit closers that exist at the present
time, be resorted to only in very exceptional cases, or in connection
with the self-acting system.</p>

<p>There are two defects, which are common to all methods of firing
submarine mines by observation, and these are:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;At night time, or in foggy weather, it cannot be employed.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;It is necessary to employ at least two observers, at a
considerable distance apart, who to effect a proper action at
the right moment, must work in perfect unison. These
defects alone are sufficient to explain the preference
given to a self-acting method of closing the electric circuit
at the precise moment of a vessel being in position over
a mine by those governments who have adopted electrical
submarine mines as a means of coast defence.</div>

<p><i>Methods of Firing by Observation.</i>&mdash;There are several methods of firing
by observation, of which the following are the ones principally used:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;By pickets or range stakes.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;By cross bearings.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;By intersectional arcs fitted with telescopes.</li>
<li>4.&mdash;The Prussian system.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Intersection by Pickets or Range Stakes.</i>&mdash;In narrow channels and at
short distances, this system of ascertaining the relative position of a
hostile vessel and a submarine mine may be used, provided that skilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and careful men are employed to work it. Two or more pickets or
stakes are arranged in front of the firing station in such a manner that
a vessel passing up the channel on the prolongation of these stakes
will be over a mine. This arrangement should of course always be
considered as an extempore one; it was used on several occasions by
the Confederates during the American civil war.</p>

<p><i>Firing by Cross Bearings.</i>&mdash;The simplest method of so determining
the relative position of a vessel and a submarine mine, and exploding
it at the right moment, is that in which observers are placed on the
prolongation of the mines. This mode is shown at <a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a>, where
<i>m</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>m</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>m</i><sub>3</sub>, &amp;c., and <i>n</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>n</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>n</i><sub>3</sub>, &amp;c., are the mines; <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, the points in
prolongation of the mines where the observers are stationed; <i>D</i> the
firing battery, and <i>s</i>, and <i>s</i><sub>1</sub> two hostile vessels.</p>

<p>At the stations <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> firing keys are placed, at the former one
for each separate mine, perfectly distinct and insulated from each other,
at the latter a single key. The pivot points of the series of keys at <i>A</i>
are connected by separate wires to one pole of the firing battery <i>D</i>, the
other pole of which is connected by a single cored insulated cable to
the pivot point of the key at <i>B</i>; the contact points of the series of
keys at <i>A</i> are connected by separate line wires as <i>A m</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>A m</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>A m</i><sub>3</sub>, &amp;c.,
to the different mines, while the contact point of the key at <i>B</i> is put
to earth. Thus it will be seen that, in the case of the row of mines, <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>,
<i>m</i><sub>2</sub>, &amp;c., unless the key at <i>B</i>, and the key at <i>A</i>, of either of those mines
are both pressed down at the same instant, no current can pass, and
therefore none of those mines can be exploded.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a id="Fig_65"></a><a id="Fig_64"></a><a id="Fig_63"></a><a id="Fig_62"></a>

<img src="images/i_112.jpg" width="500" height="802" alt="Plate XVI" /><a id="Plate_XVI"></a>
</div>

<p>In the case of the vessel <i>S</i>, though at <i>C</i>, she is on the prolongation
of the line <i>A m</i><sub>5</sub>, <i>C</i>, and therefore the key of the mine <i>m</i><sub>5</sub>, is pressed
down at <i>A</i>, yet not being on the prolongation of the line <i>B</i>, <i>E</i>, the key
at <i>B</i> is not pressed down, therefore the firing battery is not thrown in
circuit, or the mine <i>m</i><sub>5</sub> exploded, but when the vessel <i>s</i> reaches the
position <i>N</i>, that is over the mine <i>m</i><sub>3</sub>, she being on the prolongation of
the lines <i>A m</i><sub>3</sub>, and <i>B E</i>, the key (<i>m</i><sub>3</sub>) at <i>A</i>, and the key at <i>B</i>
would both be pressed down, and therefore the mine <i>m</i><sub>3</sub> exploded, and
the ship destroyed. In the case of a vessel passing through an
interval between any two mines at such a distance as to be out of the
radius of destructive effect of either of the mines belonging to the first
row (which is shown at <i>s</i><sub>1</sub>,) only the key at <i>B</i> would be pressed down,
and thus the vessel enabled to pass safely through, but only to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to grief at the second or third row of mines, provided they have been
properly placed, and separate though similar arrangements as in the
case of the line of mines, <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>m</i><sub>2</sub>, &amp;c. have been made.</p>

<p><i>Firing by a Preconcerted Signal.</i>&mdash;At <a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a> is represented a somewhat
similar, though a much simpler plan of the foregoing system, by
employing a preconcerted signal at the station <i>B</i> in the place of the
firing key and insulated cable, as in the former case. The only
material difference in the arrangement of these two methods, is that in
the latter case the pole of the firing battery at <i>A</i>, which in the former
case was connected to the firing key at <i>B</i>, is put direct to earth. As
will be readily understood, this latter system requires great coolness
and nerve on the part of the operator at <i>A</i>, who has not only to watch
the vessel passing across his intersections, but also to be on the alert
to receive the signal from the observer at <i>B</i>. Should it ever be
necessary to adopt this latter system, it will be found advisable to
employ two men at station <i>A</i>, one to watch station <i>B</i>, the other to
attend to the firing key and intersections. A separate signal-flag for
each line of mines, and also a separate firing arrangement, would be
required. As in many cases it would not be practicable to have a
station in such an advanced position as at <i>B</i>, in <a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a> and <a href="#Fig_65">65</a>, on
account of the danger of its being cut off by an enemy, another combination
becomes necessary. In this instance the station <i>B</i> is placed
on the opposite side of the river, &amp;c., to that on which the station <i>A</i> is
placed, and a series of firing keys, instead of a single one, is here used,
necessitating a multiple cable between the stations <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, in the
place of single cored cable; the manner of manipulating this method
is very similar to that previously described.</p>

<p><i>Firing by Intersectional Arcs fitted with Telescopes.</i>&mdash;The foregoing
methods of firing by cross bearings are replete with many serious
defects, to remedy which, to a considerable extent, special arrangements
have been devised, that is, the employment of intersectional arcs
fitted with telescopes at the stations <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66</a> and <a href="#Fig_67">67</a> show the arrangements of these arcs, the former
being the one used at the firing station <i>A</i>, the latter at the converging
station <i>B</i>. At each station one arc is provided for each row of mines
placed in position. The firing arc <a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66</a> consists of a cast iron frame
<i>a</i>, with three feet <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, these being provided with levelling screws.</p>

<p>To ascertain when this frame is level, a circular spirit level is attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
thereto, a telescope <i>d</i> provided with one horizontal and three vertical
cross wires, supported on Y's, admitting of vertical motion and attached
to an upright <i>e</i>. A mill-headed screw <i>f</i> enables the telescope <i>d</i> to be
raised or lowered; the telescope, which is rigidly connected to a
vernier <i>g</i>, traversing over a graduated arc <i>h</i>, can be moved rapidly in a
lateral direction by means of a rack and pinion arrangement <i>i</i>, and it
can be clamped in any position by means of the screw <i>h</i>. Sights are
fixed on the telescope in a vertical plane passing through its axis. To
the outer rim of the frame of the arc, which is smooth, are secured the
sights <i>l l</i> (shown on a large scale at Fig. 68), to give the direction of
the mines. These sights are provided each with a brass point of V
form, <i>m</i>, and a binding screw, <i>n</i>, in metallic connection with each
other, but insulated by means of an ebonite plate from the rest of the
metal of the sight. One end of a short piece of insulated wire is
attached to the binding screw <i>n</i>, and the other passes through a hole
in the base of the sight and projects below it; <i>o</i> is a brass tube rigidly
connected to and moving with the upright carrying the telescope <i>d</i>,
and projecting in front of this latter. A brass spring <i>p</i> (see Fig. 69)
is attached to, but insulated from the outer extremity of this tube, and
is so arranged as to make contact with the V point <i>m</i> on the sight, by
means of a corresponding projection fitted to its under side. An insulated
wire passing the tube <i>o</i>, the outer end of which is connected to
a screw on the spring <i>p</i>, forms a metallic connection between this
projection and the firing key.</p>

<p>At <a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a> is shown an enlarged view of the front of the sight; in
addition to the V projection <i>m</i>, and binding screw <i>n</i>, it is fitted with a
capstan-headed screw to bear against the inner rim of the frame, and a
thin wire upright <i>t</i> for giving the alignment of the mine, to which a
disc is attached, on which the number of the mine is affixed.</p>

<p>When the distance between the station and the mine is only about
one mile, an ordinary eyepiece is used in the place of the telescope <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>At <a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a> is represented the arc employed at the converging
station, which with the exception of there being no tube <i>o</i>, and only
one sight, is precisely similar in construction to the one used at the
firing station, and which has been described.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Application of the Intersectional Arc Method.</i>&mdash;The application of the
method of firing by observation, by means of intersectional arcs fitted
with telescopes, is shown at <a href="#Fig_70">Fig. 70</a>. <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, and <i>E</i> are three of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
larger kind of arcs, one being used for each row of mines at the firing
station <i>A</i>. At the converging station <i>B</i>, one of the smaller arcs is used
for each row of mines, as shown at <i>F</i>, <i>G</i>, and <i>H</i>. <i>S</i>, <i>S</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>S</i><sub>2</sub>, are the
signalling apparatus, the <i>F</i> terminals of which are connected to the
sights <i>l</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>l</i>, <a href="#Fig_69">Fig. 69</a>, of arcs <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>E</i>. Firing keys <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i> at station <i>A</i>
are connected to each arc, and to three of the cores of the cable connecting
the two stations <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, respectively. At the converging
station <i>B</i>, three firing keys <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i> are connected to earth and to
three cores of the connecting cable respectively. The remaining core
of this cable is connected to the recording instruments <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>. The
action of the arcs, &amp;c., will be readily understood from the diagram
at <a href="#Fig_70">Fig. 70</a>.</p>

<p>This arrangement does not interfere with the action of the circuit
closer, as all that is effected by the observing arc circuit is to put the
signalling battery current at the converging station <i>B</i> to earth instead
of at the circuit closer.</p>

<p><i>Prussian System of Firing by Observation.</i>&mdash;The principle on which
this system is based, depends upon the proposition that if <i>c d</i>, in the
triangle shown in <a href="#Fig_71">Fig. 71</a>, be always kept parallel to <i>H B</i>, then <i>A c</i>, <i>c d</i>,
<i>d A</i> bear exactly the same proportion to each other as <i>A B</i>, <i>B H</i>, <i>H A</i> do
to one another; so that by means of the small triangle <i>A d c</i>, the
lengths of the sides of the large triangle <i>A B H</i> can be obtained, and
hence the position of the point <i>H</i>, the base <i>A B</i> being of course known.
In <a href="#Fig_71">Fig. 71</a> at <i>A</i> there is a slate table representing the roadstead, and
upon it the exact position of every torpedo is laid down, corresponding
to their position in the roadstead. At <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, 500 yards apart,
telescopes having cross wires are placed; at <i>A</i> a long narrow straight-edged
strip of glass <i>A d</i> is arranged to move in unison with the
telescope at <i>A</i>; and by the application of dynamo electricity, a similarly
constructed piece of glass <i>c d</i> moves in exact unison with the telescope
at <i>B</i>, and having its pivot at <i>C</i>; that is to say, <i>C d</i> keeps parallel with
<i>B H</i>, the line of sight of the observer at <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>Then if the observers at <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> have got a ship in their telescopes,
the point of intersection <i>d</i> of the two pieces of glass <i>A d</i> and <i>C d</i>
gives the position of the ship on the slate table at <i>A</i>, and when this
point <i>d</i> comes over the position of any one mine on the slate, it is known
that the ship is over that particular mine in the harbour, and she may
be destroyed accordingly, by throwing the firing battery into circuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>By the employment of electricity and a mirror, the great defect of
this method, viz., the necessity of employing four people to manipulate
it, would be remedied. The foregoing is a modification of Siemens's
method of ascertaining distances at sea, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Rules observed in Planting Mines.</i>&mdash;In placing a system of submarine
mines in position, the following are some of the chief points to be
attended to, this work depending in a great measure on local circumstances,
and on the method that is to be adopted in exploding and
mooring them:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;The plan of defence must be carefully laid down on a chart, on
a scale of not less than six inches to the mile, and on this
plan are to be marked the sites of the observing stations,
the positions of each mine, circuit closer, and junction box,
with their corresponding numbers, and also of the electric
cables.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;The position of each mine having been determined, should be
marked off by buoys.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;The utmost care should be taken to lay the electric cables, so
that they shall be as far as possible away from the mines
in the vicinity of which it may be necessary to take them,
so as to lessen the liability of injury to them, by the
explosion of the latter.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;The electric cables should be laid parallel, and never be
allowed to cross directly over each other, otherwise the
operation of underrunning them will be much complicated,
also a certain amount of slack should be allowed to
facilitate in picking the cables up for repair, &amp;c.</div>

<div class='hang2'>5.&mdash;Every manner of device is to be used to conceal the electric
cables, such as laying dummies, making detours inland, &amp;c.</div>

<div class='hang2'>6.&mdash;All marks indicating position of the mines to be removed, after
the mines have been placed in position.</div>

<div class='hang2'>7.&mdash;The identity of each cable and mine to be very carefully
preserved throughout, by means of a number.</div>

<div class='hang2'>8.&mdash;A number of electro contact mines should be placed in advance
of the leading line of mines, at irregular intervals, to
prevent the enemy, having once ascertained the position of
one mine of a line, from knowing within limits the position
of the others of that line.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>In connection with a system of defence by electrical submarine
mines, the following batteries are required:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;Firing battery.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;Signalling, or shutter battery.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;Testing battery.</li>
<li>4.&mdash;Telegraph battery.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Firing Battery.</i>&mdash;The firing battery should be suited to the nature
of the fuze employed, and should possess considerable excess of power
to enable it to overcome accidental defects, such as increased resistance
in the various connections, or defective insulation in the line wire, &amp;c.</p>

<p>As platinum wire or low tension fuzes are now universally adopted
as the mode of ignition for submarine mines, it will be only necessary
to describe those electrical batteries which are most suitable as an
exploding agent in connection with such fuzes; these are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;Siemens's dynamo low tension machine.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;Von Ebner's Voltaic battery.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;Chromic acid or Bichromate Voltaic battery.</li>
<li>4.&mdash;Leclanché's Voltaic battery.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Siemens's Low Tension Dynamo Electrical Machine.</i>&mdash;This instrument
consists of an electro magnet and an ordinary Siemens armature,
which, by the turning of a handle, is caused to revolve between the poles
of the electro magnet. The coils of the electro magnet are in circuit
with the wire of the revolving armature, and during rotation the residual
magnetism of the soft iron electro magnet cores at first excites weak
currents which pass into the electro magnet coils, increasing the
magnetism of the core, thus inducing still stronger currents in the
armature wire. This accumulation by mutual action goes on until the
limit of magnetic saturation of the iron cores of the electro magnets is
reached.</p>

<p>By the automatic action of the machine, the powerful current so
produced is sent into the leading wire or cable to the fuze to be
exploded.</p>

<p>In this apparatus the electric current passes continuously through
the line wire until a sufficiently powerful current is generated to heat
or fuze the bridge of the fuze, and so ignite the gun-cotton priming.
The coils of the armature and electro magnets are wound with wire of
large diameter, to a total resistance of 8 to 10 Siemens units, or 7·6 to
9·5 ohms, in about 2,000 windings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>With a platinum wire weighing 1·65 grains per yard, 6-1/2 inches
can be fuzed on short circuit, and 14 inches can be heated to redness.</p>

<p>The total weight of this machine, which is manufactured by
Messrs. Siemens Brothers, is about 60 lbs.</p>

<p><i>Advantages of Siemens's Dynamo Electrical Machine.</i>&mdash;The advantages
of such a machine over Voltaic apparatus are:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;The absence of chemical agents.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;There is less liability to get out of order.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;No special knowledge is required to work them, or to keep
them in order.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;Greater durability.</div>

<p>The great defect of this and all similar machines is that the electric
force has to be developed by turning a handle for a certain time before
it is possible to generate a current sufficiently powerful to ignite a
fuze, which defect, in connection with a system of defence by self-acting
submarine mines, particularly at night, renders them inferior to
Voltaic batteries, as under such circumstances, an apparatus is required
that will cause an electric current to flow at any moment when the
circuit is completed.</p>

<p>The application of steam power would to a certain extent remedy
the above-mentioned defect, but the cost of such a method, compared
to that of a Voltaic arrangement, would be far too great to allow of its
superseding the latter arrangement.</p>

<p><i>Von Ebner's Voltaic Battery.</i>&mdash;This form of Voltaic battery, which
may be considered as a modification of that known as Smee's, was
designed by Baron von Ebner, colonel of the Austrian imperial corps
of engineers, for use in connection with the Austrian system of submarine
defence, by self-acting electrical mines.</p>

<p>A section of one of these cells is shown at <a href="#Fig_72">Fig. 72</a>. It consists of
a glass vessel <i>a</i>, to contain the diluted sulphuric acid, within which
is suspended a plate <i>b</i> of platinised lead, which is bent round into a
cylindrical form to fit close around the inner surface of the glass
vessel. In the centre of this latter is hung a porcelain perforated cup
<i>c</i>, containing some cut-up zinc and mercury to keep it (the zinc)
amalgamated. The top of each cell is furnished with a porcelain cover,
through which the wires attached to the positive and negative poles of
the cell project.</p>

<p>Due to the large quantity of liquid contained in the cell, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
tendency to alter its internal resistance is retarded; also by the
arrangement of the porcelain cup, above detailed, the consumption
of zinc and mercury, which in an ordinary Voltaic battery is very
considerable, is materially diminished.</p>

<p><i>Chromic Acid or Bichromate Battery.</i>&mdash;This form of battery is very
similar to Grove's, the difference being that, in the place of the nitric
acid as the exciting liquid, either chromic acid, or a solution of bichromate
of potash, sulphuric acid and water is substituted.</p>

<p>A form of this battery, as designed by Dr. Hertz, is used in connection
with the German system of torpedo defence.</p>

<p><i>Leclanché Voltaic Battery.</i>&mdash;This form of Voltaic battery was invented
by M. Leclanché, some twelve years ago. At <a href="#Fig_73">Fig. 73</a> is shown
a cell of this battery in its original form. The positive pole <i>a</i> consists
of a plate of graphite in a porous pot <i>b</i>, and surrounded by a mixture
of peroxide of manganese and graphite. The negative pole <i>c</i> is a rod
or pencil of amalgamated zinc. The whole is enclosed in an outer
vessel of glass <i>d</i> containing a solution of sal ammoniac.</p>

<p>A modified form of the Leclanché cell as used in a firing battery
is shown at <a href="#Fig_74">Fig. 74</a>. It consists of an ebonite trough or outer vessel <i>a</i>
about 16" long, 9" deep, and 2-3/4" wide. The negative pole or zinc
plate <i>b</i> is of similar shape to the trough <i>a</i>, but with its base removed,
and does not fit the trough exactly, the space between it and the
trough being left to ensure the former being completely surrounded
by the sal ammoniac solution; the positive pole, or carbon element,
consists of four gas carbon plates <i>c</i> attached together at their head by
means of lead, and enclosed in a flannel bag, in which they are firmly
embedded in the peroxide of manganese mixture; the positive element
is of such a shape that it fits loosely between the sides, and is nearly
of the same height as the zinc plate.</p>

<p>The object of such a form of cell was to obtain an electric current
of large <i>quantity</i>, with as few cells as possible, by which means the loss
of power which might occur from the employment of a great number
of small cells is avoided.</p>

<p><i>Advantages of a Leclanché Firing Battery.</i>&mdash;The advantages of the
Leclanché firing battery are:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;The absence of chemical action when the battery circuit is not
complete, and consequently there is no waste of material.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;Requires little or no looking after.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;It may be kept ready for action in store without in any way
deteriorating.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;It is comparatively very cheap.</div>

<p>These advantages combine to make a Leclanché battery the most
suitable of any other form of electrical battery for use as the exploding
agent for electrical submarine mines, and it is now universally used
for such purposes.</p>

<p><i>Signalling Battery.</i>&mdash;The signalling battery should be so constituted
as to be capable of working the electro magnet of the shutter apparatus
effectually when the circuit is closed direct to earth, and yet
not so powerful as by the continuous passage of the current generated
by it to fire the fuze in the mine. In the case of a platinum wire
fuze being in the circuit, plenty of power may be given to the battery
without fear of a premature explosion from this cause, but in the case
of a high tension fuze it is necessary to be very careful in order to
guard against such a contingency.</p>

<p>As in the case of a signalling or shutter battery, the electric
current will be continually flowing, it is necessary to employ a constant
battery, or one that requires least trouble and expense to maintain it
in working order, and it is for this reason that a modified form of
Daniell battery has been adopted to work the shutter apparatus.</p>

<p><i>Daniell Signalling Battery.</i>&mdash;At <a href="#Fig_75">Fig. 75</a> is shown the manner of
arranging a Daniell cell. A glass or porcelain vessel <i>a</i> contains a
saturated solution of sulphate of copper, in which is immersed a copper
cylinder <i>b</i> open at both ends and perforated by holes; at the upper
part of this cylinder there is an annular shelf <i>d</i>, also perforated by
holes, and below the level of the liquid; this is for the purpose of
supporting crystals of sulphate of copper for the replacing of that
decomposed as the electrical action proceeds. Inside the cylinder <i>b</i>
is a thin porous vessel <i>c</i> of unglazed earthenware; this contains either
water, or a solution of common salt, or dilute sulphuric acid, in which
is placed the cylinder of amalgamated zinc <i>e</i>. Two strips of copper
<i>p</i> and <i>n</i>, fixed by binding screws to the copper and to the zinc, serve
for connecting the elements in series, or otherwise.</p>

<p>For the purposes of testing, either the Leclanché or Daniell battery
specially arranged, or the Menotti battery, which is really a modification
of the Daniell, may be used.</p>

<img src="images/i_126.jpg" width="500" height="799" alt="Plate XIX" /><a id="Plate_XIX"></a>
</div>

<p><i>Description of a Menotti Cell.</i>&mdash;A Menotti cell, shown at <a href="#Fig_76">Fig. 76</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
consists of a copper cup containing some crystals of sulphate of copper
and covered with a fearnought diaphragm <i>a</i>, placed at the bottom
of an ebonite cell <i>b</i>; over this cup is put some sawdust, and resting
on top of this is a disc of zinc <i>c</i> on another piece of fearnought. The
upper portion of the zinc and its connection with the insulated wire
are carefully insulated. Fresh water poured on the sawdust renders
the battery active.</p>

<p><i>Description of a Menotti Test Battery.</i>&mdash;<a href="#Fig_77">Fig. 77</a> represents a plan
of the top of such a test battery with a 20-ohm galvanometer attached
thereto. The connections are made as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>One of the wires <i>w</i> of the object to be tested is attached to the
terminal <i>f</i>, which is also connected by an insulated wire to the copper
cup <i>a</i>; the other main wire <i>w</i><sub>1</sub> is attached to the terminal <i>g</i> of the
galvanometer; <i>h</i>, the other terminal of the galvanometer, is connected
by a short piece of wire <i>k</i> to the terminal <i>l</i> of the contact key <i>m</i>;
and the contact point <i>n</i> is in connection with the zinc plate <i>c</i>; thus
the current from the battery flows along the wire <i>w</i> through the
object to be tested, back along the wire <i>w</i><sub>1</sub>, through the coils of the
galvanometer, along the wire <i>k</i> to the contact key <i>m</i>, and if this is
pressed down to the zinc plate <i>c</i>, so completing the circuit.</p>

<p>To steady the needle of the galvanometer a bar magnet is used,
which is inserted in the space <i>r</i>. The whole of the apparatus is
enclosed in a leathern case fitted with a cover and strap.</p>

<p>This is a very compact and simple form of test battery, and will
be found extremely useful in boats, &amp;c., when placing mines in
position.</p>

<p><i>Telegraph Battery.</i>&mdash;For the purposes of telegraphing between
torpedo stations, &amp;c., a form of Leclanché battery, known as No. 3
commercial pattern, is generally used.</p>

<p><i>Voltaic Batteries.</i>&mdash;The following points in connection with the
use of voltaic batteries, which are taken from Beechey's 'Electro
Telegraphy,' should be carefully observed:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;Each cell of a battery should be carefully insulated.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;The floors and tables in the battery room should be kept
scrupulously clean and dry, so as to prevent the least
leakage or escape of the current.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;The plates of a battery should be clean.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;Porous cells should be examined, and cracked ones replaced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></div>

<div class='hang2'>5.&mdash;No sulphate of zinc or dirt should be allowed to collect at the
lips of the cells.</div>

<p>In the case of a Daniell battery&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;The solutions should be inspected daily, and crystals of
sulphate of copper added as required.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;The zinc plate must not touch the porous cell, or copper will
be deposited on it (the zinc).</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;The battery should be charged with sulphate of zinc from the
first.</div>

<p>4.&mdash;The copper solution must be watched and prevented from
rising over the edge of the porous jar, the tendency of
such solutions being to mix with each other by an action
termed <i>osmosis</i>.</p>

<p>These being in addition to foregoing general directions for Voltaic
batteries.</p>

<p><i>Defects in a Voltaic Battery on its Current becoming Deficient.</i>&mdash;On
the electric current of a Voltaic battery becoming deficient, the following
defects should be looked for:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;Solutions exhausted; for instance, sulphate of copper in a
Daniell's entirely or nearly gone, leaving a colourless
solution.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;Terminals or connections between the cells corroded, so that
instead of metallic contact there are oxides of almost
insulating resistance intervening in the circuit.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;Cells empty, or nearly so.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;Filaments of deposited metals stretching from electrode (pole)
to electrode (pole).</div>

<p>Also intermittent currents are sometimes produced by loose wires
or a broken electrode, which alternately makes and breaks contact
when shaken. Inconstant currents are also sometimes produced when
batteries are shaken. The motion shakes the gases off the electrodes,
thus increasing temporarily the electro-motive force of the battery.</p>

<p><i>Firing Keys and Shutter Apparatus.</i>&mdash;The following is a description
of the various firing keys and shutter signalling apparatus, which is used
in connection with a system of electrical submarine mines. By means
of the former the firing or other batteries may be thrown into circuit
at will, whilst by means of the latter the firing battery is thrown
in circuit without the aid of an operator, and a signal at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
instant given, indicating that a certain mine of the system has been
struck.</p>

<p><i>Description of a Series of Firing Keys.</i>&mdash;At <a href="#Fig_78">Fig. 78</a> is shown a plan
and section of a series of firing keys as arranged for firing several
mines by observation.</p>

<p>It consists of a strong wooden frame <i>a</i>, of a convenient form for
the purpose of attaching it to the firing table by screws through the
holes <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>. On this frame a series of keys <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i> are fixed at convenient
intervals. These consist of a strong brass spring firmly
screwed to a series of brass plates <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>d</i> on the front of the wooden
box <i>a</i>. From these latter short copper wires pass through the woodwork,
and of such a length that, when required, the mine wires may
be easily attached by means of binding screws, as shown at <i>f</i>. The
inner end of each key is fitted with an ebonite knob (which is shown at
<i>c</i> in the section) to insulate the hand of the operator when using the
key. On the frame, and directly under each of the ebonite knobs,
are arranged a series of metallic points <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>, so placed that on
either of the keys <i>c</i> being pressed down, a perfect contact is made
between it and its respective metallic point; <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>h</i> are copper wires
leading from the metallic points <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>g</i> through the box, and of such
a length that binding screws <i>f</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>f</i> can be easily attached to them
when necessary.</p>

<p>A single firing key of an improved form is shown at <a href="#Fig_79">Fig. 79</a>. It
consists of a strong wooden box <i>a a</i>, weighted at the bottom with lead
in order to steady the key on the table, &amp;c., on which it may be placed;
on the inside of the bottom of the box is fixed a piece of ebonite, by
which means the metallic point <i>b</i>, and the terminal of the firing key <i>c</i>,
are insulated from each other; <i>d d'</i> are two terminals at the end of the
box, to which the circuit wires are attached, one of these terminals is
connected in metallic circuit to the firing key at <i>c</i>, the other one to
the metallic point <i>b</i>; a wooden cover <i>h</i>, fitted with a catch <i>k</i>, protects
the connections of the wires; by means of a plate, and catch <i>e e</i>,
the key can be rendered inactive, thus preventing the danger of a
premature closing of the electric circuit; by means of a spring <i>s</i> a
break is always established between the key and the metallic point.
It is immaterial to which of the two terminals <i>d d'</i> either wire is
connected.</p>

<p><i>The Morse Firing Key.</i>&mdash;This form of key is so well known in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
connection with the Morse telegraph, that it is not necessary to
describe it.</p>

<p>It is usually employed in torpedo work in connection with a
testing and firing table.</p>

<p><i>The Shutter Apparatus.</i>&mdash;The shutter signalling and firing apparatus
was devised to enable the firing battery current to be thrown
in circuit without the aid of a personal operator, the signalling
current (which is always kept in circuit) at the same instant ringing
a bell, by which is known the particular mine that has been
struck.</p>

<p>At <a href="#Fig_80">Fig. 80</a> is represented a diagram of such an apparatus. <i>a</i> is an
armature working on a pivot between the two horns of an electro
magnet <i>b b</i>, and held in position by a spiral spring <i>c</i>; the latter is in
connection with a regulating screw, by which more or less pressure
may be brought to bear in an opposite direction to that of the
attractive action of the electro magnet. A stud <i>i</i> regulates the
distance to which the armature may be drawn back; <i>d</i> is a shutter on
which a reference number for each mine should be indicated, attached
to a lever pivoted at the point <i>e</i>, the inner arm of which is just long
enough to catch under the point of the armature <i>a</i>; when a current
of sufficient strength is passed through the coils <i>b b</i> of the electro
magnet, the armature <i>a</i> is attracted, releasing the lever attached to
the shutter <i>d</i>, which by its own weight falls into the position shown
by the dotted lines. <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> are two mercury cups, the former being
in connection with the signalling current, and the latter with the
firing current. When the lever is horizontal and the shutter drawn
up and ready for action, the circuit of the signalling battery <i>s</i> is
completed through the mercury cup <i>f</i>, along an arm <i>h</i> of the lever to
the pivot <i>e</i>, and thence to the mine by the line wire <i>w</i>. When the
circuit closer is struck by a passing vessel, and consequently the
shutter thrown into the position shown by the dotted lines, another
arm <i>k</i>, a prolongation of the lever, falls into the mercury cup <i>g</i>, which
latter is in connection with the firing battery <i>F</i>. The armature <i>a</i> is
prevented from coming into actual contact with the horns of the
electro magnet by two small studs. The object of this is to prevent
any effect of residual magnetism which might otherwise interfere with
the rapidity of action of the armature when released and drawn back
by the spring <i>c</i>.</p>

<img src="images/i_132.jpg" width="500" height="801" alt="Plate XX" /><a id="Plate_XX"></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The object of employing Mercury Cups.</i>&mdash;Mercury cups were devised
in the place of the springs used in connection with the original
design of a shutter apparatus, for the reason that electrical circuits
dependent on the pressure of springs are always liable to interruption
from dirt or oxide intervening between the points of contact.</p>

<p><i>Shutter Apparatus used with a Circuit Breaker.</i>&mdash;When the circuit
breaking system is used with the shutter signalling apparatus, the
action of the armature in releasing the lever must be reversed; that
is to say, that when the current is passing and the armature <i>a</i> attracted
to the electro magnet <i>b b</i>, the shutter <i>d</i> must be held up, and when
the current ceases, and the armature <i>a</i> drawn back by the spring <i>c</i>, the
lever must be released, and the shutter allowed to fall. This is
effected by altering the end of the lever, so that it hooks into, instead
of abutting against the armature <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>To each shutter apparatus an electric bell is fitted, by which notice
is given when a circuit closer has been struck. For general service,
a box containing seven such shutter signalling and firing apparatus has
been adopted, a plan of which is represented at <a href="#Fig_81">Figs. 81</a>, <a href="#Fig_82">82</a> and <a href="#Fig_83">83</a>.
The connections of the different circuits are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The insulated wire of the upper bobbin of the electro magnet is
connected to the spring of the armature; the pivot of the lever is
connected with the right-hand terminal <i>B</i>, or main line connection on
the top of the box; the insulated wire from the lower bobbin is connected
to the middle brass plate <i>k</i> in the front ledge of the apparatus,
the circuit from <i>B</i> to <i>k</i> being thus completed. The front adjoining
brass plate <i>A</i>, provided with a terminal, is connected with the negative
pole of the signalling battery, the positive pole being put to earth.</p>

<p>On a brass plug being put in the hole <i>l</i>, the signalling current will
flow to the plate <i>k</i>, thence through the lower and upper bobbin to
the spring of the armature, along the latter to the shutter lever, and
from the pivot through the main line wire to the mine. The innermost
brass plates <i>H H</i> are all connected in the same metallic circuit,
and to them are attached by means of the binding screw <i>D</i> the test
battery and galvanometer. Thus on the brass plug being removed
from <i>l</i>, and placed in <i>m</i>, the signalling battery is cut out of circuit,
and the test battery thrown in. In this way the condition of each
individual mine may be ascertained while the connections of the
remaining mines are left undisturbed. The positive pole of the firing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
battery (the negative being to earth) is connected to the terminal <i>S</i> at
the right-hand corner of the lower ledge of the box; the plate to
which the terminal <i>S</i> is fixed is divided at <i>G</i>, the left-hand portion
being connected to a bar which runs horizontally the whole length of
the box, and in metallic connection with each mercury cup <i>g</i>, <a href="#Fig_80">Fig. 80</a>.
A brass plug is placed in the hole <i>G</i>, and when from any cause the
lever drops, the firing battery will be thrown into circuit, and the
mine to which the lever that has fallen is attached will be exploded.</p>

<p><i>Shutter Instrument and Observing Telescope.</i>&mdash;Each mine is given a
number, which is put on the disc of the shutter instrument connected
to it, and also on the corresponding tablet <i>C</i>. From the brass plate in
connection with the spring <i>c</i>, <a href="#Fig_80">Fig. 80</a>, a wire is taken to the terminal <i>f</i>,
<a href="#Fig_81">Fig. 81</a>, on top of the box. From this terminal a wire is led to the
connections of the observing telescope, and thus the mines can be fired
by judgment if required, without the aid of the circuit closer.</p>

<p>The signal battery current is always circulating, even when the
system is in a state of rest, but in consequence of the resistance placed
in this circuit, which may be either a resistance coil in the circuit,
added to the resistance of the fuzes, when high tension fuzes are used,
or only the former resistance in the case of low tension fuzes, this
current is too feeble to form an electro magnet; directly, however,
a circuit closer is struck, this resistance is cut out, and thus the signal
battery current becomes sufficiently powerful to work the electro magnet
of that particular mine.</p>

<p>The circuit of the signal battery, and that to the observing telescope,
are broken the instant the lever commences to fall.</p>

<p>To enable the apparatus to be used on the circuit breaking system,
a spare lever <i>E</i> is provided for that purpose with each box.</p>

<p>The object to be gained by a system of testing is to ascertain the
condition of the electrical submarine mines placed in the defence of a
harbour, &amp;c., and should there exist any fault, not only to detect its
exact position and cause, but also its magnitude, so that it may be at
once determined whether it is necessary to remedy the fault, or
whether the electrical apparatus is sufficiently powerful to overcome
the defect.</p>

<p><i>Tests.</i>&mdash;There are two distinct kinds of tests, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;Mechanical tests.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;Electrical tests.</li>
</ul>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_83"></a><a id="Fig_82"></a><a id="Fig_81"></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Mechanical tests are applied to ascertain that the mechanical
arrangements of the shutter apparatus, circuit closers, and all similar
appliances work efficiently and easily; that the several parts of the
mine case when put together for service are thoroughly watertight;
that the chains, wire cables, and ropes in connection with the mooring
apparatus are of sufficient strength to perform the work required of
them; that the weights of the anchors, or sinkers, are such as to keep
the mines in position after submersion; and that the case of the
mine be sufficiently strong to enable it to bear the external pressure
due to the depth at which it may be submerged for a considerable
time without any leakage.</p>

<p>The foregoing tests of the mine case and moorings would of course
be performed during the process of manufacture, but to prevent any
chance of failure they should be repeated before being employed on
actual service.</p>

<p><i>Electrical Tests.</i>&mdash;Electrical tests are those which are applied to the
several component parts of the system, to ascertain that the electrical
conditions necessary to a successful result exist.</p>

<p>The importance of being able to carry out the above in its entirety
is understood when it is remembered that a submarine mine becomes
practically valueless unless it acts efficiently at the single instant of
time that it would be required so to do.</p>

instruments that are employed in connection with a system of electrical
tests:&mdash;</p>

<p>Electrometers indicate the presence of a statical charge of electricity,
by showing the force of attraction or repulsion between two conducting
bodies placed near together. This force depending in the first place
on the quantity of electricity with which the conducting bodies are
charged, ultimately depends on the difference of potential between
them; an electrometer is therefore strictly an instrument for measuring
difference of potential.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<p>Sir William Thomson's quadrant electrometer is the most perfect
form of electrometer yet constructed, and the one usually employed in
cable testing. It consists of a very thin flat aluminium needle spread
out into two wings, and hung by a wire from an insulated stem inside
a Leyden jar, which contains a cupful of strong sulphuric acid, the
outer surface of which forms the inner coating of the Leyden jar. A
wire stretched by a weight connects the aforesaid needle with this
inner coating. A mirror, rigidly attached to this needle by a rod,
serves to indicate the deflection of the needle by reflecting the image
of a flame on to a scale. The needle hangs inside four quadrants,
which are insulated by glass stems: each pair of opposite quadrants
are in electrical connection. Above and below the quadrants two tubes,
at the same potential as the needle, serve to screen it and the wires in
connection with it from all induction except that produced by the four
quadrants. Suppose the needle charged to a high negative potential
(-), then if the quadrants are symmetrically placed, it will deflect
neither to the right nor to the left, so long as the near quadrants are
at the same potential. If one of these be positive relatively to the
other, the end of the needle under them will be repelled from the
negative quadrant to the positive one, and at the same time the other
end of the needle will be repelled from in the opposite direction. This
motion will be indicated by the motion of the spot of light reflected
by the mirror, and the number of divisions which the spot of light
traverses on the scale measures in an arbitrary unit the difference of
potential between the + and - quadrants.</p>

<p>The reflecting electrometer being a very delicate instrument,
requires careful handling, and should only be used by a practised
electrician. Its use would therefore be restricted to important stations,
and special tests of a delicate nature.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Thomson's Reflecting Galvanometer.</i>&mdash;A galvanometer is an instrument
intended to detect the presence of a current and measure its
magnitude.</p>

<p>The most sensitive galvanometer as yet constructed is the reflecting
galvanometer of Sir William Thomson, a diagram of which is shown at
<a href="#Fig_84">Fig. 84</a>.</p>

<p>A small piece of magnetised steel watch spring, 3/8ths of an inch
long, is fastened with shellac on the back of a little round concave
mirror, and of about the size of a fourpenny piece. This is suspended
by a piece of unspun silk thread in the centre of a coil of many
hundred turns of fine copper wire insulated with silk, and well protected
between the turns with varnish. The two ends of the coils are
soldered to terminal screws <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, so that any conducting wire can be
joined up to it as required. The little mirror hangs in the middle of
its coil, with the magnet lying horizontally. By means of a lamp <i>L</i>
placed behind the screen, the light of which passes through a slit <i>M</i>,
and is thrown on the face of the mirror, a spot of light is reflected on
the scale <i>N</i>.</p>

<p>When a current passes through the coil, the little magnet is deflected,
and since the magnet is attached to the mirror, which is very
light, both are deflected as forming one body, and the spot of light
moves accordingly along the scale <i>N</i>.</p>

<p>A powerful steel magnet <i>S</i> is placed above the coil, and can be
moved up or down, whereby the directive force of the earth may be
increased or weakened. This magnet <i>S</i> is used to steady the spot of
light, which otherwise would shake about, and there would be no
certainty about the measurement. A second magnet <i>T</i> is placed perpendicular
to the magnetic meridian, to adjust the zero of the instrument,
i.e., to bring back the spot of light to a fiducial mark at the centre
of the scale when no current is passing.</p>

<p>This instrument should only be used at important stations, and
when special tests of a delicate nature are required to be applied.</p>

<p><i>Astatic Galvanometer.</i>&mdash;An astatic galvanometer is that in connection
with which an astatic needle is employed, by the use of which the
sensitiveness of a galvanometer is greatly increased.</p>

<p>An astatic needle is a combination of magnetised needles <i>with their
poles turned opposite ways</i>.</p>

<p>At <a href="#Fig_85">Fig. 85</a> a diagram of such an instrument is shown. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
magnets <i>D</i> and <i>C</i> are joined, with the north pole of one over the south
pole of the other, forming one suspended system. In the ordinary form
of astatic galvanometer the needles <i>D</i> and <i>C</i> are about two inches long,
and are each covered by a coil, these latter being so joined that the
current must circulate in opposite directions round the two so as to
deflect both magnets similarly. The deflection of the needles <i>D</i> and <i>C</i>
is observed by means of a pointer or glass needle <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, rigidly connected
with the astatic system by a prolongation of the brass rod
connecting the needles <i>D</i> and <i>C</i>. The coils are flat and of the shape
indicated in <a href="#Fig_85">Fig. 85</a>, and are also made in two halves, placed side
by side with just sufficient space between them to allow the rod to
hang freely.</p>

<p>This form of galvanometer, though less delicate than the preceding
one, is still a very sensitive one, and should only be applied in the case
of fine and delicate tests.</p>

<p><i>Differential Galvanometer.</i>&mdash;A differential galvanometer consists of
a magnetic needle surrounded by two separate coils of equal length
and material carefully insulated from each other and wound in opposite
directions. In using it one circuit acts against the other. If a current
of equal strength were passing through each there would be no deflection
of the needle, because the influence in both directions is equal. If
one current were stronger than the other, the needle would be deflected
by the stronger.</p>

<p>This form of galvanometer will be found extremely useful in connection
with a system of electrical tests.</p>

<p>Latimer Clark's double shunt differential galvanometer is the
instrument best adapted for submarine mine tests.</p>

<p><i>Detector Galvanometer.</i>&mdash;A detector galvanometer is usually made
with a vertical needle, and is employed to detect and roughly estimate
the strength of a current where no particular accuracy is
required.</p>

<p>It consists of a magnetic needle pivoted in the centre of a coil of
insulated wire, and having an index needle attached to move with it,
the latter appearing on a dial, divided into 360 equal arcs or portions:
a diagram of such an instrument is shown at <a href="#Fig_86">Fig. 86</a>.</p>

<p>This instrument should be of small size and portable form, and as
sensitive as it is possible to make it, under such conditions.</p>

<p><i>Three Coil Galvanometer.</i>&mdash;The three coil galvanometer is provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
with a vertical needle, and is in other respects very similar in appearance
to the detector galvanometer before described. It is formed with
three coils of 2, 10, and 1000 ohms resistance; each coil is connected
with a brass plate on the top of the box which encloses the whole, and
may be switched into circuit by means of a plug at will. The object
of the three resistances is to suit the different resistances that may
occur, with a perfect, or imperfect state of the electrical combination in
connection with each mine. A diagram of this instrument is shown at
<a href="#Fig_87">Fig. 87</a>, the dotted portions are inside the case.</p>

<p><i>Thermo Galvanometer.</i>&mdash;A thermo galvanometer is an instrument
used to ascertain the power of a firing battery which is employed to
ignite platinum wire or low tension fuzes.</p>

<p>The form of thermo galvanometer generally used in connection
with a test table, is arranged as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Two ebonite studs, fitted with brass connecting screws, are fixed to
the lid of a box containing some resistance coils, and placed in circuit
with them; these studs, placed about ·3 of an inch apart, are arranged
to receive a piece of platinum wire which is stretched from one stud to
the other; the firing battery being placed in circuit with the platinum
wire, and the resistance coils, its working power would then be tested
by the fusion of the wire through a given electrical resistance, as
indicated by the resistance coils put in circuit.</p>

<p>Another form of thermo galvanometer, which is very compact and
portable, is shown at <a href="#Fig_88">Fig. 88</a>. It consists of a wooden box <i>a</i>, with a
cover of ebonite <i>b</i>, within the box is placed a resistance coil <i>c</i>; <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>
are two ebonite standards ·3" apart, the former of which is connected
by a copper wire with the terminal <i>f</i>, the latter to the terminal <i>g</i>; the
terminal <i>h</i> is similarly connected to the contact piece <i>k</i>, and the
terminal <i>l</i> to the firing key <i>m</i>, at <i>n</i>; the resistance coil <i>c</i> is connected
to the terminal <i>g</i> and to the copper wire <i>n</i>; the platinum wire (of
which several lengths are used, according to the resistance of the coil
<i>c</i>) is placed between the standards <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>. To test a battery, it is only
necessary to connect it to the terminals <i>f</i> and <i>h</i>, when by pressing
down the key <i>m</i> the power of the battery, according as to its fusing or
not the platinum wires, will be ascertained; the use of the terminals <i>g</i>
and <i>l</i> is to cut out the resistance, which is effected by connecting
them by means of a copper wire.</p>

<p><i>Siemens's Universal Galvanometer.</i>&mdash;Siemens's universal galvanometer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
is an instrument combining in itself all the arrangements
necessary for the following operations:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;For measuring electrical resistances.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;For comparing electromotive forces.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;For measuring the intensity of a current.</li>
</ul>

<p>The instrument which is shown in elevation and plan at Pl. xxiii.,
<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a> and <a href="#Fig_2">2</a> respectively, consists of a sensitive galvanometer which
can be turned in a horizontal plane, combined with a resistance bridge
(the wire of which bridge instead of being straight is stretched round
part of a circle). The galvanometer has an astatic needle, suspended
by a cocoon fibre, and a flat bobbin frame wound with fine wire. The
needle swings above a cardboard dial divided in degrees; as however,
when using the instrument the deflection of the needle is never read
off, but the needle instead always brought to zero, two ivory limiting
pins are placed at about 20 degrees on each side of zero.</p>

<p>The galvanometer is fixed on a graduated slate disc, round which
the platinum wire is stretched. Underneath the slate disc three
resistance coils of the value of 10, 100, and 1000 Siemens' units are
wound on a hollow wooden block, which protrudes at one side, and on
the projection carries the terminals for the reception of the leading
wires from the battery and unknown resistance. The adoption of three
different resistance coils enables the measuring of large as well as
small resistances with sufficient accuracy.</p>

<div class="caption">GALVANOMETERS FOR TESTING.</div>
<img src="images/i_144.jpg" width="500" height="788" alt="Plate XXII" /><a id="Plate_XXII"></a>
</div>

<p>The whole instrument is mounted on a wooden disc, which is
supported by three levelling screws, so that it may be turned round its
axle. On the same axle a lever is placed which bears at its end an
upright arm, carrying a contact roller. This roller is pressed against
the platinum wire round the edge of the slate disc by means of a
spring acting on the upright arm, and forms the junction between
the <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> resistances of a Wheatstone's bridge, which resistances
are formed by the platinum wire on either side of the contact roller,
one of the three resistance coils forming the third resistance of the
bridge. <i>G</i> is the galvanometer, <i>k</i> a milled head from which the
needles are suspended, and by turning <i>k</i> they can be raised or lowered,
<i>m</i> is the head of a screw which arrests or frees the needle when in
motion. <i>h</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>h</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>h</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>h</i><sub>4</sub>, are the terminals of the respective ends of the
three resistance coils, viz., 10, 100, and 1000 units, which are wound on

by means of stoppers, and therefore one or more of the resistances may
be brought into circuit as desired, and to the ends of these terminals
the wires of the artificial resistances are connected as shown on
diagrams Pl. xxiv., <a href="#Fig_C1">Figs. 1</a>, <a href="#Fig_C2">2</a>, <a href="#Fig_C3a">3<i>a</i></a> and <a href="#Fig_C3b">3<i>b</i></a>; <i>f</i> is the graduated slate disc,
round which the platinum wire is stretched in a slight groove at the
edge of the disc, and is inserted in such manner that about half its
diameter protrudes beyond the slate. The ends of the platinum wire
are soldered to two brass terminals <i>l</i> and <i>l</i><sup>1</sup>, which are placed at the
angles formed by the sides of the gap in the slate disc, and which
form the junctures, as in the ordinary resistance bridge, between <i>A</i>,
<i>n</i>, and the galvanometer on one side, and <i>B</i>, <i>X</i>, and the galvanometer
on the other side, of the parallelogram. The terminal <i>l</i> is permanently
connected by a thick copper wire or metal strip to terminal
<i>h</i>_{1}, and the other terminal <i>l</i><sup>1</sup> is connected in a similar manner to
terminal III.</p>

<p>Slate is adopted for the material of which to make the disc <i>f</i>,
because it is found by experience to be the material which is the least
sensitive to variations in the weather or temperature.</p>

<p>The slate disc is graduated on its upper edge through an arc of 300
degrees, zero being in the centre, and the graduations figured up to
150 on each side at the terminals <i>l</i> and <i>l</i><sup>1</sup> of the bridge wire.</p>

<p>In the centre of the circular plate <i>E</i> of polished wood, supported
upon three levelling screws <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, a metal boss is inserted, in which
turns the vertical pin <i>a</i> which carries the instrument. This pin, being
well fitted to the boss, supports the instrument firmly, but at the same
time allows it to be turned freely round its vertical axis without losing
its horizontal position when once obtained.</p>

<p>On the arm <i>D D</i>, which turns on the pin <i>a</i>, and somewhat behind
the handle <i>g</i>, there is a small upright brass arm <i>d</i> turning between two
screw points <i>r</i>, and carrying in a gap at its upper end a small platinum
jockey pulley <i>e</i> turning on a vertical axis. This pulley forms the
movable contact point along the bridge wire, against which it is
kept firmly pressed by means of a spring acting on the arm <i>d</i>. The
arm <i>D D</i>, which is insulated from the other parts of the apparatus, is
permanently connected with the terminal I. On the top of <i>d</i> a pointer
<i>Z</i> or a vernier is fixed, which laps over the upper edge of the slate disc
and points to the graduations.</p>

<p>To the pin <i>a</i> is attached a circular disc of polished wood <i>C</i>, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
one inch thick, and having a groove turned in its edge for the reception
of the insulated wires composing the resistances. The disc <i>C</i> has a
projection <i>c</i>, which carries the five insulated terminals marked I., II.,
III., IV., V., as shown on <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a> and <a href="#Fig_B2">2</a>, Pl. xxiii. Terminals III.
and IV. can be connected by a plug, II. and V. by the contact key <i>K</i>.
Terminal I. is in connection with the lever <i>D D</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_B3">Fig. 3</a> and <a href="#Fig_B4">4</a>, Pl. xxiii. show the shunt box supplied with the
galvanometer if specially desired; the copper connecting arms <i>a</i>, <i>a</i> are
screwed to the terminals II. and IV. By inserting a plug at <i>c</i> (<a href="#Fig_B4">Fig. 4</a>,
Pl. xxiii.), the galvanometer is put out of circuit altogether, whilst
by plugging either of the other holes shunts of the value of 1/9, 1/99, or
1/999, are introduced into the circuit, and the effect upon the galvanometer
is reduced to 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000, respectively of what it would
have been without the insertion of the shunt.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_B5">Fig. 5</a> and <a href="#Fig_B6">6</a>, Pl. xxiii., show a battery commutator allowing to
bring into the circuit four different amounts of battery power. It is
placed in the battery circuit whenever consecutive tests with different
batteries are desired to be made, it being only necessary to change the
place of the stopper in the battery commutator, the terminal screw <i>a</i>
of the battery commutator being connected to terminal V. of the
galvanometer, and the screws <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i> to various sections of the battery:
see diagram of connections, <a href="#Fig_C4">Fig. 4</a>, Pl. xxiv.</p>

<p>The application of the universal galvanometer will be clear from
the diagrams on Pl ii.; instructions, however, for its practical use
are added further on, and also tables for use when measuring conducting
resistances.</p>

<p>As will be seen from diagram, <a href="#Fig_C1">Fig. 1</a>, Pl. xxiv., the proportion
between the unknown resistance X, and the artificial resistance <i>n</i> is,
when the deflection is read off on the side of the slate disc marked <i>A</i>:</p>

<p><i>Measuring Electrical Resistances.</i>&mdash;For this purpose the instrument
is arranged as a Wheatstone's balance. The connections are made as
shown at Pl. xxiv., <a href="#Fig_C1">Fig. 1</a> and <a href="#Fig_C5">5</a>, where <i>X</i> is the unknown resistance.</p>

<div class='hang2'><i>a.</i>&mdash;The needle <i>i</i> is to be brought to the zero point of the small
cardboard scale by turning the galvanometer <i>G</i> round its
vertical axis, taking care that the needle moves with
perfect freedom.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>b.</i>&mdash;The pointer or vernier <i>Z</i> is to be brought, by means of the
handle <i>g</i>, to the zero point of the large scale on the slate
disc.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>c.</i>&mdash;A plug is to be inserted between the terminals marked III. and
IV.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>d.</i>&mdash;The holes 10, 100, and 1000 are, two of them, to be plugged,
and one left open, according to the extent of the unknown
resistance to be measured; either 10 or 100 must be left
open if the resistance is small, and 1000 if it is large.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>e.</i>&mdash;The two ends of the unknown resistance are to be connected to
terminals II. and IV.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>f.</i>&mdash;The two poles of some galvanic battery are to be connected to
terminals I. and V.</div>

<p>When the above-mentioned connections have been made, and on
depressing the key <i>K</i>, the battery current is sent into the combination
and deflects the needle, say, to the right-hand or <i>B</i> side of the instrument,
the pointer or vernier <i>Z</i> must then be pushed, by means of the
handle <i>g</i>, to the <i>B</i> side of the instrument. If this is found to increase
the deflection of the needle <i>i</i>, the pointer <i>Z</i> should be pushed to the
other or <i>A</i> side of the instrument beyond the zero point of the large
scale until the needle remains stationary when the key <i>K</i> is depressed.</p>

<p>The number indicated by the vernier <i>Z</i> should be read off carefully,
and notice taken whether it is on the <i>A</i> or <i>B</i> side of the large scale.
This number must then be referred to the galvanometer table,<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> when
the figure opposite to the number, multiplied by the resistance unplugged,
is the resistance of <i>X</i>. The value of the resistance to be
determined will be thus found by a single operation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<p>Supposing the reading to be 50 on the <i>A</i> side of the large scale,
the resistance <i>n</i> unplugged having been 100 units, we get according to
the before-mentioned law of resistance bridge the following proportion
(see <a href="#Fig_B5">Fig. 5</a>, Pl. xxiii<small>A</small>.):&mdash;</p>

<p>For measuring very small resistances a single cell will be found
sufficient; but for large resistances more should be used, say, 15 to 20.
If very accurate measurements of small resistances are to be taken, the
screw at the end of the moving arm <i>D D</i> should receive one battery
wire, terminal V. receiving the other.</p>

<p><i>Comparing Electromotive Forces.</i>&mdash;For this purpose Professor E. du
Bois-Reymond's modification of Poggendorff's compensation method
is used.</p>

<p>The connections are made as shown at Pl. xxiii<small>A</small>., <a href="#Fig_B2">Fig. 2</a> and <a href="#Fig_B6">6</a>.</p>

<p>For comparing two electromotive forces <i>E</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>E</i><sub>2</sub>, a third electromotor
of higher electromotive force <i>E</i><sub>0</sub> is used, and two separate
tests taken.</p>

<p>The manipulations <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are to be the same as before.</p>

<div class='hang2'><i>c.</i>&mdash;The hole between III. and IV. to be left unplugged.</div>

are to be connected to the terminals III. and V.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>f.</i>&mdash;The poles of the battery whose electromotive force <i>E</i><sub>1</sub> is to
be compared are connected to terminals I. and IV. in such
a manner that the similar poles of the two electromotors
are joined to terminals I. and III., and to IV. and V. respectively.</div>

<p>When depressing the key <i>K</i> the galvanometer needle will be deflected
and can be brought back to zero by turning the pointer <i>Z</i> either
to the right or to the left. Should for instance the pointer have to be
brought to 30° on the <i>A</i> side we have the following equation&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p>The electromotor <i>E</i><sub>2</sub> is now to be inserted in the place of <i>E</i><sub>1</sub>, and
the galvanometer needle, when it deflects, again brought back to zero
by moving the pointer <i>Z</i>. If for instance the pointer has to be pushed
to 40° on the <i>B</i> side to obtain equilibrium we have&mdash;</p>

<p>By eliminating <i>n</i> from equations 1 and 2 we have</p>

<div class='center'>
E<sub>1</sub> : E<sub>2</sub> = (150 - 30) : (150 + 40) = 12 : 19&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;(3).<br />
</div>

<p>The two electromotive forces are in the same proportion as the two
observed distances of the pointer <i>Z</i> from 150° on the <i>A</i> side of the
instrument.</p>

<p><i>For measuring the Intensity of a Current.</i>&mdash;For this purpose the
instrument is simply used as a sine galvanometer. The connectionsare made as shown at Pl. xxiv., <a href="#Fig_C3a">Figs. 3<i>a</i></a> and <a href="#Fig_B7">7</a>.</p>

<p>The manipulations <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i> same as in the second case.</p>

<div class='hang2'><i>e.</i>&mdash;Connect one pole of a battery to terminal II. and put the other
pole to earth.</div>

<div class='hang2'><i>f.</i>&mdash;Connect the line to terminal IV.</div>

<p>The galvanometer is then to be turned in the same direction as
the needle is deflected until the needle coincides with the zero point.
Whilst this is being done the large scale on the slate disc will move
under the pointer <i>Z</i>, which must be left stationary; the sine of the
angle indicated by <i>Z</i> will thus give the value proportionate to the
strength of the current. Should the shunt box be required, it has to
be connected with terminals II. and IV.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a> shows the same connections as <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>, but without the shunt
box, and with the battery commutator. Fig. 3<sub>a</sub> shows diagram of the
same connections but with the key <i>K</i>, and <a href="#Fig_C3b">Fig. 3<sub>b</sub></a> the same without
the key.</p>

<p><i>A Shunt.</i>&mdash;A "Shunt" is a second path offered to a current traversing
a given circuit, or portion of a circuit, so as to diminish the amount
of the current flowing through that portion of the circuit. In the
diagram shown at <a href="#Fig_89">Fig. 89</a> the shunt diminishes the amount of the
current flowing along the circuit between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>If only 1/Nth of the current is to pass along the circuit between
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> (of resistance <i>R</i>) then the resistance of the shunt must
equal R/(N - 1).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>By the aid of shunts it is quite possible to make use of very
sensitive instruments to measure powerful currents.</p>

<p><i>Commutators or Switch Plates.</i>&mdash;A commutator or switch plate is an
apparatus by which the direction of currents may be changed at will,
or by which they may be opened or closed. Bertin's commutator,
which is represented at <a href="#Fig_90">Fig. 90</a>, consists of a small base of hard wood
on which is an ebonite plate, this by means of the handle <i>m</i> is turned
about a central axis between two stops <i>c</i> and <i>c'</i>. On the disc are
fixed two copper plates, one of which <i>o</i> is always positive, being
connected by the axis and by a plate (+) with the binding screw <i>P</i>,
which receives the positive electrode of the battery; the other copper
plate <i>i</i>, <i>e</i>, bent in the form of a horse-shoe, is connected by friction
below the disc with a plate (-), which plate is connected with the
negative electrode <i>N</i>. On the opposite side of the board are two
binding screws <i>b</i>, and <i>b'</i>, to which are attached two elastic metal plates
<i>r</i>, and <i>r'</i>.</p>

<p>On the disc being turned as shown in the figure, the current
coming by the binding screw <i>P</i> passes into the piece <i>o</i>, the plate <i>r</i>,
and finally the binding screw <i>b</i>, which by means of a copper wire leads
the current to the apparatus in connection with <i>b</i>; then returning to
the binding screw <i>b'</i>, the current reaches the plate <i>r'</i>, the piece <i>i</i>, <i>e</i>,
and so to the battery by the binding screw <i>N</i>.</p>

<p>If the disc is turned so that the handle <i>m</i> is half way between <i>c</i>
and <i>c'</i>, the pieces <i>o</i> and <i>i</i>, <i>e</i>, being no longer in contact with the plates
<i>r</i> and <i>r'</i>, the current will not pass. If <i>m</i> is turned as far as <i>c</i>, the
plate <i>o</i> will then touch <i>r'</i>, and the current pass to <i>b'</i>, and return by <i>b</i>,
thus reversing its direction.</p>

<p>"Peg" switches are also often used; they are arranged so that
the removal or insertion of a brass peg or plug cuts out, or completes
a circuit.</p>

<p><i>Rheostat.</i>&mdash;A rheostat is an instrument used for the comparison of
resistances.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a id="Fig_92"></a><a id="Fig_91"></a><a id="Fig_90"></a><a id="Fig_89"></a>
<div class="caption">SHUNT, COMMUTATOR, RHEOSTAT.</div>
<img src="images/i_160.jpg" width="500" height="799" alt="Plate XXV" /><a id="Plate_XXV"></a>
</div>

<p>Wheatstone's rheostat, which is shown in elevation at <a href="#Fig_91">Fig. 91</a>,
consists of two cylinders <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, one of brass and the other of
non-conducting material, so arranged that a copper wire can be
wound off the one on to the other by turning a handle <i>C</i>. The
surface of the non-conducting cylinder <i>B</i> has a screw thread cut in
it for its whole length, in which the turns of the copper wire lie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
so that its successive convolutions are well insulated from each other.
Two binding screws <i>D</i>, <i>D'</i> connected with the ends of the copper
wire are provided, to which the circuit wires are connected. A scale
is attached at <i>E</i>, by means of which the number of convolutions on <i>B</i>
can be read off; and parts of a revolution are indicated on a circle at
one end. The handle <i>C</i> can be shifted from one cylinder to the other.</p>

<p>Supposing the rheostat introduced into a circuit, and the whole of
the copper wire wrapped on the metal cylinder <i>A</i>, then, on account
of the large section of this metal cylinder, its resistance may be
entirely neglected, but for every convolution of the wire on the
non-conducting cylinder <b>B</b>, a specific resistance is introduced into
the circuit. The amount of resistance can thus be varied as gradually
as desired by winding on and off the cylinder <i>B</i>. This instrument is
often used in connection with the thermo galvanometer.</p>

<p><i>Resistance Box.</i>&mdash;The general arrangement of a resistance box is
shown in the diagram <a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a>.</p>

<p>Between two terminal binding screws <i>T</i> and <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> secured on a
vulcanite slab are fixed a series of brass junction pieces <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>; each
of these is connected by a resistance coil to its neighbour, as shown
at 1, 2, 3, and 4. A number of brass conical plugs with insulating
handles of vulcanite are provided, which can be inserted between any
two successive junction pieces, as between <i>T</i> and <i>a</i>, or <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>With all the plugs inserted, the electrical current will flow direct
from <i>T</i> to <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, the large metallic junction pieces directly connected by
the plugs would offer no sensible resistance; but if all the plugs were
removed, then the current would flow through each of the coils 1, 2,
3, and 4, and the resistance in the circuit would be the sum of the
resistances of those four coils. With the plugs arranged as in the
figure, the current would flow through coil 4 only, and the resistance
in the circuit would be equal to the resistance of that coil.</p>

<p><i>Wheatstone's Balance.</i>&mdash;The electrical conductivity of a body is
determined by ascertaining the ratio between the resistance of a
certain length of the conductor in question, having a given section,
to that of a known length of a known section of some substance taken
as a standard.</p>

<p>For this purpose Wheatstone's bridge in connection with a box of
resistance coils is the most convenient method.</p>

<p>At <a href="#Fig_94">Fig. 94</a> is shown Wheatstone's balance (Post-office pattern),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and at <a href="#Fig_93">Fig. 93</a> the apparatus is reduced into the form of a parallelogram,
which is the usual diagram of Wheatstone's bridge. The
theory of the bridge is as follows:</p>

<p>Four conductors <i>A B</i>, <i>B C</i>, <i>A D</i>, and <i>D C</i> are joined at <i>A</i> and <i>C</i>
to the poles of a battery <i>Z</i>; the resistance between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> is <i>R</i>;
that between <i>A</i> and <i>D</i> is <i>r</i>; that between <i>D</i> and <i>C</i> is <i>R</i><sub>1</sub>; and that
between <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> is <i>x</i>, the unknown resistance to be measured. A
convenient constant ratio is chosen for <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>r</i>, such as equality
1 to 10, 1 to 100, or 1 to 1000; and then <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> is adjusted until no
current flows through the galvanometer <i>G</i>; when this is the case we
have R : <i>r</i>=R<sub>1</sub> : <i>x</i>, or <i>x</i> = (<i>r</i>/R) × R<sub>1</sub>; so that if <i>r</i> = R/100, <i>x</i> will be equal
to R<sub>1</sub>/100.</p>

<p>Two keys <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are inserted; the current is wholly cut off the
four conductors until contact is made at <i>a</i>; and then after the
currents in the four conductors have come to their permanent
condition, contact is made at <i>b</i> to test whether any current flows
through the galvanometer. The three resistances <i>R</i>, <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>r</i> and
the resistance of the galvanometer should be small if <i>x</i> is small, and
great if <i>x</i> is great.</p>

<p>The conductors <i>A B</i> and <i>A D</i> of the bridge are each formed of
three resistance coils having a resistance of 10, 100, and 1000 ohms
respectively, inserted between the terminals <i>B</i> and <i>D</i> of the balance,

<p>The conductor <i>D C</i> is formed of a set of resistance coils from 1 up
to 4000 ohms, amounting altogether to 11,110 ohms, inserted between
the terminals <i>D</i> and <i>C</i> of the balance; in the balance, a brass plug
being inserted between the terminals <i>D</i> and <i>D</i><sub>1</sub>, they may be considered
as one terminal <i>D</i>. The conductor <i>B C</i> is the wire to be
tested, and is connected to the terminals <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> of the balance.</p>

<p><i>Measurement of Resistances.</i>&mdash;When a resistance is to be measured
that is within the range of the coils in <i>R</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>R</i> and <i>r</i> are made equal.
The needle of the galvanometer will move in a different direction,
either to the right or to the left, according as the resistance in <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> is
greater or less than the line wire <i>x</i>. The needle remains at zero
only when the resistance in <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> is equal to that in <i>x</i>. For <i>r</i> : <i>R</i> :: <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> : <i>x</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>When the resistance of <i>x</i> is greater than that of <i>R</i><sub>1</sub>, as in an
insulation test, the resistance in <i>r</i> is made <i>less</i> than that in <i>R</i>, in order
that <i>r</i> and <i>R</i> may have such a proportion one to the other as will
enable the coils in <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> to balance a resistance in <i>x</i>, greater than their
own, that is to say, greater than 11,100 ohms; thus <i>r</i> : <i>R</i> :: <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> : <i>x</i>,
or 10 : 1000 :: 10,000 : 1,000,000, the resistance in the line to be
tested would be 1,000,000 ohms, supposing the values of <i>r</i>, <i>R</i> and <i>R</i><sub>1</sub>
to be respectively 10, 1000, and 10,000 ohms.</p>

<p>When the resistance to be tested is less than that of the least coil
in <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> (1 ohm), then the resistance in <i>r</i> is made greater than in <i>R</i>.
Thus <i>r</i> : <i>R</i> :: <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> : <i>x</i>, or 100 : 10 :: 2 : 0·2; the resistance of the line
to be tested would in this case be 1/20 of an ohm.</p>

<p><i>Manipulation.</i>&mdash;In all cases the key in connection with the battery
should first be depressed, then the galvanometer key, making very
short contacts by the latter, just sufficient to show the direction of
the deflection, until the coils in <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> are nearly adjusted, otherwise
considerable time will be lost in making a series of tests, owing to
the swing given to the needle, which will take some little time before
it again remains steady at zero. When once the coils in <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> are
adjusted, and a balance obtained, it should be ascertained whether the
needle will remain steady when contact is made and broken.</p>

<p><i>Test Tables.</i>&mdash;In connection with a system of testing electrical submarine
mines, for the sake of convenience and simplicity it is necessary
to use a table (termed a "Test Table"), on which all the apparatus used
for the purpose of testing are fixed. Several forms of tables have been
designed for such a purpose. At <a href="#Fig_95">Fig. 95</a> is shown the method of
arranging such a table.<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a></p>

<p><i>A</i> is an astatic galvanometer placed between two switch plates,
<i>B</i> and <i>C</i>; ten other similar switch plates, 1, 2, 3, 4, <i>D</i>, 5, 6, 7, <i>E</i>, and
8, are arranged in front of the galvanometer <i>A</i>; <i>F</i>, <i>G</i>, and <i>H</i> are
three terminal plates; <i>K</i> is a box of resistance coils used in connection
with the thermo galvanometer <i>M</i>; <i>L</i> is a firing key, and <i>N</i> a battery
commutator; <i>O</i> is a three-coil galvanometer; <i>R</i> is a Wheatstone
balance (Post-office pattern).</p>

<p>The ten switch plates, 1, 2, 3, 4, <i>D</i>, &amp;c., are used for the connection
of any particular line to be tested, as well as for the earth connections
and instruments employed in that operation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<p><i>"Sea Cell" Tests.</i>&mdash;The arrangement shown in the figure is that
required in connection with the sea cell test, and Mr. Brown's method
of keeping certain earth plates in a bucket instead of in the sea.</p>

<p>If two plates of suitable metal to form a Voltaic battery are placed
in salt water and connected by a metallic conductor, a battery is
at once formed capable of producing considerable deflection on a
moderately delicate galvanometer. Testing by this arrangement has
been termed the "sea cell" test.</p>

<p><i>Arranging Earth Plates.</i>&mdash;Mr. Brown's, Assistant-Chemist to the
War Department, method of arranging the earth plates is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>A series of earth plates, such as copper, carbon, tin, zinc, &amp;c., are
placed in a bucket filled with sea water, and which is placed in the
testing room. The water in the bucket is put in connection with the
water of the sea by means of a conducting wire, terminating at one
end with a zinc plate in the bucket, and at the other with a zinc
plate in the sea. By this means the tests made with the different
earth plates in the bucket are identical with those made with corresponding
earths placed absolutely in the sea, and therefore these
latter may be done away with, the sea cell tests being entirely carried
out by means of the bucket earth plates.</p>

<p>In addition to the bucket earth plates there will be several other
earth plates in connection with the testing room, these being placed in
the sea, such as the zinc earth for the firing battery, the zinc earth
for the signalling battery, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Connections of Switch Plates.</i>&mdash;The switch plate <i>D</i> is used for the
connection of any particular mine cable which it may be required to
test. The switch plate <i>E</i> is connected with a zinc earth plate used
for testing the firing battery. This must always be in the sea. The
switch plate 1 is in connection with a zinc earth in the bucket; 2 is
attached to a copper earth plate in the bucket; 3 is attached to a
carbon earth plate in the bucket; 4 to a tin earth plate in the bucket;
5 is used for connection with the zinc signalling earth connection in
the sea; 6 is attached to a copper earth plate used for the sea cell
test, or any other purpose required, in the sea; 7 is attached to a
zinc earth plate in the sea; and 8 is a common zinc earth in the sea.</p>

<p>The terminal plates <i>G</i> and <i>H</i> are used for the connection, for
testing purposes of the negative and positive poles, of the firing
battery, and <i>F</i> is connected with a zinc earth in the sea, for a similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
purpose. These plates are in connection with the resistance coils <i>K</i>
and the thermo galvanometer <i>M</i>, employed for testing the firing battery,
the circuit being closed by the firing key <i>L</i>. Other ways of using
these plates may of course be adopted if desired. The resistance coils
<i>K</i> range from 0·5 to 100 ohms, and are composed of wire adapted for
the passage of a quantity current. A reversing key is generally used
in connection with a testing battery and the three-coil galvanometer
<i>O</i>. This reversing key would consist of two bridges completely insulated
from each other, the upper one attached to the negative, the
lower one to the positive pole of the test battery. In their normal
position both keys press against the upper bridge, and until one or
other of the keys is pressed down no current will pass, the direction
of the current being altered by pressing down a different key. The
point of each key is provided with a terminal and connected, the
one to a zinc earth through the switch plate 8, the other to one
terminal of the three-coil galvanometer when the tests are to be
applied.</p>

<p>The Wheatstone balance <i>R</i> is used in finding the resistances of
electrical cables, balancing fuzes, &amp;c. By means of a commutator,
<i>N</i>, the necessary number of cells for any particular test may be
thrown in circuit when required.</p>

<p><i>Test of Platinum Wire Fuze for Conductivity.</i>&mdash;The platinum wire
fuze may be tested electrically as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>If placed in circuit with a few cells of a Daniell or Leclanché
battery and a detector galvanometer, before the platinum wire bridge
of the fuze is fixed, there should be no deflection of the needle, for
no metallic circuit exists; if it did, such would be fatal to the
efficiency of the fuze. If similarly placed in circuit after the bridge
has been fixed, a considerable deflection of the needle should result,
such deflection being due to the current passing through the metallic
bridge, which to be efficient ought to be the sole medium through
which the circuit is completed.</p>

<p><i>Test of Resistance of Platinum Wire Fuze.</i>&mdash;The electrical resistance
of a platinum wire fuze is ascertained by means of the Wheatstone's
balance <i>R</i> and galvanometer <i>A</i>, <a href="#Fig_95">Fig. 95</a>. The terminals of the fuze
are connected to the binding screws of the balance, the commutator
<i>N</i> and galvanometer <i>A</i> being connected up in circuit. The
resistance of the coils is then adjusted by taking out plugs until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
needle of the galvanometer <i>A</i> is brought to zero, when the sum of the
resistances indicated by the unplugged coils will be equal to that of
the fuze. The resistance of a platinum wire fuze might also be
ascertained by means of a differential galvanometer instead of a
Wheatstone balance.</p>

<p>The electrical resistance of 3/10" of fine platinum wire, weighing
1·9 grains to the yard, is 3/10 of an ohm nearly (Schaw).</p>

<p><i>Testing High Tension Fuzes.</i>&mdash;High tension fuzes require very
delicate and careful management in testing them, due to the high
electrical resistance of such fuzes, which ranges from 1500 to 2000
ohms, combined with the danger of premature explosion when testing
even with a small number of battery cells. Very sensitive galvanometers,
such as the reflecting galvanometer, should if possible be
used, otherwise the mode of making the tests for conductivity and
resistance of a high-tension fuze is similar to that already given for
a platinum wire fuze.</p>

<p>Detonating fuzes should always be placed in an iron case during
the process of testing.</p>

<p><i>Insulation Test for Electrical Cables.</i>&mdash;To test an electrical cable for
insulation, it should first be put in a tank of water, or in the sea, and
allowed to soak for at least forty-eight hours. The object of this is to
allow the water to penetrate the outer protection of hemp and iron
wires, &amp;c., and to search out and get into any weak places there may be
in the insulation under the armouring. At <a href="#Fig_96">Fig. 96</a> is shown the
method of performing this test. <i>A</i> is a tank holding the electrical
cable, which has been in soak for forty-eight hours; <i>B</i> is an astatic
galvanometer; <i>C</i>, <i>Z</i> a Leclanché or Daniell battery of great power;
and <i>C</i> is an ordinary firing key. One end of the electric cable <i>D</i> is
connected to the galvanometer <i>B</i> through the firing key <i>C</i>; the other
end of the cable is very carefully insulated; one pole of the battery
is connected to the galvanometer <i>B</i>, the other is put to earth in the
tank at <i>F</i>; should the insulation be perfect, no deflection of the
needle should follow on the key being pressed down. A very slight
deflection might be observed on a moderately sensitive galvanometer,
due to the current passing through the insulation; its whole length
being immersed, the surface through which such a current would pass
would be large, and the sum of the infinitesimally small quantities
escaping over the whole length, would in the aggregate be sufficient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
deflect the needle to a small extent in completing the circuit of the
battery. Should any considerable deflection occur, it would indicate
a defect or leak in the insulation of the cable, the extent of which
would be roughly measured by the amount of such deflection.</p>

<p>By using a reflecting galvanometer a very much more delicate test
would be obtained, but for the comparatively short lengths of electric
cables used in connection with submarine mines, such accuracy is
hardly necessary.</p>

<p>To test an electric cable for conductivity, it would be only necessary
to expose the metallic conductor <i>G</i>, and put it in the water of the tank.
If the conductivity were good, then the whole of the current would
pass through the cable and the needle of the galvanometer would be
violently deflected. If the continuity were broken, no deflection would
be observed.</p>

<p><i>Defects observed in the Conductivity of the Cable.</i>&mdash;To ascertain the
position of a defect in the insulation of a cable, as indicated by the
tests above described, it would be only necessary to keep a continuous
current flowing through the cable, and gradually take it out of the
tank. If the fault existed at a single point, the deflection of the needle
would be suddenly reduced at the moment of that point of the cable
being lifted out of the water, and therefore its position would be
determined with considerable accuracy. Should several defects exist
as each was lifted out, a sudden reduction of the deflection would occur.</p>

<p><i>Discharge Test.</i>&mdash;The conductor of an electrical cable may be broken
without destroying the insulation, and on applying the foregoing tests,
good insulation would be indicated, but no conductivity, and no
information would be given as to the position of the fault. Under
such circumstances the following test must be applied:&mdash;</p>

<p>Put one pole of a very powerful battery to earth, and charge one
end of the defective cable, then immediately discharge it through a
reflecting galvanometer, and note the extreme limit of the swing of the
needle, then, charge the other end of the cable in a similar manner,
and discharge it through the same galvanometer, noting as before the
swing of the needle. This should be done three or four times, and the
average of the deflections taken. Then the position of the fault would
be indicated by the proportion between the average deflections in each
case, and the cable might safely be cut at that point. Should the precise
position of the fault not be discovered in thus cutting the cable, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
section should be tested again for conductivity, and that in which a
fault was still found to exist should be again tested by the discharge
as before.</p>

<p><i>Test of Electrical Resistance of Cable.</i>&mdash;This is effected by balancing
it against the Wheatstone balance, in a similar manner to that
explained for a fuze. The electrical resistance of the conductor of
a cable affords a very correct indication of the quality of the metal
of which it is composed. For a very delicate test the reflecting
galvanometer should be used.</p>

<p><i>Electrical Test of Insulated Joints.</i>&mdash;Insulated joints and connections,
whether of a permanent or temporary nature, should be tested electrically,
in a precisely similar manner to that explained for electric cables.</p>

<p>They should be soaked for forty-eight hours, and then tested for
insulation, conductivity, and electrical resistance.</p>

<p>In testing permanent joints special tests are carried out, which are
described by Mr. Culley in his 'Handbook of Practical Telegraphy.'</p>

<p>Voltaic batteries should be subjected to the following tests:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;For potential.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;For internal resistance.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;For electromotive force.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the purpose of testing the potential of a battery, one pole
should be put to earth, and with the other one pair of the quadrants of
a Thomson's reflecting galvanometer should be charged; when this is
done, a certain deflection of the spot of light will occur, and the amount
of such deflection, as compared with that produced by a standard cell
applied to the instrument in a similar manner, would give the relative
value of the potential of the battery.</p>

<p>The following method of determining the internal resistance of a
battery is that recommended by Mr. Latimer Clark in his book on
electrical measurements.</p>

<p>The instrument employed is a double shunt differential galvanometer,
a diagram of which is shown at <a href="#Fig_97">Fig. 97</a>. Connect the battery
and a set of resistance coils in circuit between the terminals <i>A</i> and <i>D</i>,
and insert plugs in the resistance coils so that they give no resistance;
insert plugs at <i>A</i> and <i>C</i>, and also both the shunt plugs at <i>A</i> and <i>D</i>.
The current will now flow through one half of the galvanometer circuit
only, being, however, reduced to 1/100 of its amount by the shunt <i>D</i>; the
deflection of the needle must be carefully read. The plug <i>A</i> must now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
be removed to <i>B</i>, which causes the battery current to flow through both
halves of the galvanometer (each being shunted). The circuit will
now be as shown in the figure, and the needle will of course be
deflected somewhat more than before. Now unplug the resistance coils
which are in circuit with the battery until the deflection of the needle
is reduced to its original amount, and the resistances unplugged will be
equal to the internal resistance of the battery.</p>

<p>The following is another method of ascertaining the internal resistance
of a battery cell.</p>

<p>A circuit is formed, consisting of the battery cell, a rheostat, and a
galvanometer, and the strength <i>C</i> is noted on the galvanometer. A
second cell is then joined with the first, so as to form one of double the
size, and therefore half the resistance, and then by adding a length <i>l</i>
of the rheostat, the strength is brought to what it originally was, <i>C</i>.</p>

<p>Then if <i>E</i> is the electromotive force, and R the resistance of cell, <i>r</i>
the resistance of the galvanometer, and other parts of the circuit, the
strength <i>C</i> in the one case is C = E / (R + <i>r</i>), and in the other = E / ((1/2)R + <i>r</i> + <i>l</i>),
and since the strength in both cases is the same, R = 2<i>l</i>, i.e., the internal
resistance of the cell is equal to twice the resistance corresponding to
the length <i>l</i> of the rheostat wire.</p>

<p>The comparative electromotive force of a battery may be determined
by means of a double shunt differential galvanometer in the following
method, as recommended by Mr. Latimer Clark.</p>

<p>"This can only be done relatively in terms of some other standard
battery. First determine the resistance of the standard and of the
other cells to be measured; then insert the shunt plugs at <i>A</i> and <i>D</i>,
<a href="#Fig_97">Fig. 97</a>, and also at <i>C</i> and <i>B</i>, and join up the standard cell in circuit
with a resistance coil to the terminals <i>A</i> and <i>D</i>, and unplug the
resistance coils until a convenient deflection is obtained, say 15°; note
the sum of the resistances in circuit, including that of the battery
galvanometer, resistance coil and connecting wires; now change the
battery for another, and by unplugging the resistance coils bring the
needle again to the same deflection, 15°; having again found the total
resistance in the circuit, the relative electromotive force will be
directly proportional to these resistances."</p>

<p>The electromotive force of a battery may also be measured statically
by means of Thomson's quadrant electrometer, the poles of the battery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
being connected with the two chief electrodes of the instrument, in
which arrangement no current will pass, and the electromotive force
will be directly indicated by the difference of potential observed.</p>

<p>In the case of a quantity battery, that is, a battery capable of fusing
a fine platinum wire, its electromotive force and internal resistance
may be determined by means of the resistance coils <i>K</i>, and thermo
galvanometer <i>M</i>, shown at <a href="#Fig_95">Fig. 95</a>.</p>

<p><i>Tests after Submersion.</i>&mdash;After an electrical submarine mine has
been placed in position, it should be immediately tested to ascertain
that all is right, and similar tests should be applied at intervals to
ascertain that the charge remains dry; that the insulation and conductivity
of the electric cable remains the same; and that its electrical
resistance indicates a state of efficiency.</p>

<p>The nature of the tests applied to determine these points will
depend upon the nature of the combination in which the mine is
arranged.</p>

<p>The manner of applying the "sea cell" test, by which is ascertained
the condition of a system of electrical submarine mines, will be readily
understood from the following examples.</p>

<p>The arrangements for testing to ascertain whether a charge is dry,
or wet, is shown at <a href="#Fig_98">Fig. 98</a>.</p>

<p><i>z</i> is a plate of zinc introduced in the circuit within the charge, and
between the fuze and the shore; another earth plate of carbon <i>x</i> is
connected with the electric cable beyond the fuze, forming the ordinary
earth connection of the system at that point; and at home a copper
earth plate <i>c</i> is used.</p>

<p>First, in the case of a dry charge with the insulation and conductivity
of the cable, good; under these circumstances there would be
formed a sea cell between the earth plates <i>x</i>, and <i>c</i>, which would
produce a certain deflection of the needle of a galvanometer <i>g</i>, which
is placed in the circuit, and in a certain direction.</p>

<p>Secondly, in the case of a charge becoming wet, through leakage,
with the insulation and conductivity of the cable, good; under these
circumstances, a sea cell would be formed between the plates <i>c</i> and <i>z</i>,
causing a different deflection of the needle in amount and in direction,
by which it would be at once indicated that the charge had become wet.</p>

<div class="caption">TEST TABLE, DIFFERENTIAL GALVANOMETER.</div>
<img src="images/i_174.jpg" width="500" height="790" alt="Plate XXVII" /><a id="Plate_XXVII"></a>
</div>

<p><i>"Sea cell" Test for Insulation.</i>&mdash;Again, in the case of the insulation
of the electric cable being damaged to such an extent as to expose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
copper conductor. Under these circumstances there would be formed
a sea cell between the copper earth plate <i>c</i>, and the exposed copper
conductor of the cable, by which a certain definite deflection of the
galvanometer would be observed, which deflection would differ in
character from that produced by the copper carbon sea cell, when the
insulation of the cable was good, and the system in working order, and
therefore it would indicate that some change in the electrical conditions
of the system had occurred. The fact that a leak existed in the
insulation would be proved by changing the earth plate at home from
copper to zinc, carbon, tin, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the case of no deflection being produced on the galvanometer, on
applying the sea cell test, a want of continuity, or inefficient connections
would be indicated.</p>

<p>The foregoing afford examples of the vast utility of the "sea cell"
in connection with a system of electrical tests for submarine mines,
numerous variations of which may be effected by employing a series
of earth plates, of different metals, at the home end of the circuit, in
connection with a carbon and zinc earth plate at the other end. And
the mode of manipulating these tests may, by means of numerous
switch plates, as shown at <a href="#Fig_95">Fig. 95</a>, be made extremely simple and
efficient.</p>

<p><i>Armstrong's System of Electrical Testing.</i>&mdash;A very simple method
of testing electrical submarine mines, with which low tension fuzes are
used, has been devised by Captain Armstrong, R.E., and is shown at
<a href="#Fig_99">Fig. 99</a>. <i>a</i> is the electric cable leading from the shore; <i>b</i> the cable
attached to a polarised relay <i>c</i>, and connecting the charge through
the fuze <i>f</i> to the earth; <i>b'</i> the cable, attached to another polarised
relay <i>c'</i>, and connecting the mine with the circuit closer; the polarised
relay <i>c</i>, in the mine, is arranged to be worked by a positive current,
that is to say, the wire surrounding the core is so wound as to increase
the polarity of the electro magnet, near the armature <i>d</i>, when a
positive current is passed through it, and to diminish the polarity
when a negative current is passed through the wire surrounding the
core; the polarised relay <i>c'</i> within the circuit closer is arranged to be
worked by a negative current, the coil being so wound as to produce
an influence exactly the reverse of <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>Then, a positive current passing along the line wire <i>a</i>, the armature
<i>d</i> in the charge will be attracted, while <i>d'</i> will remain unaffected;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
again, if a negative current be circulated, the armature <i>d'</i> within the
circuit closer will be attracted, while the armature <i>d</i> will remain
unaffected. Two insulated wires forked together are wound round
each electro magnet, one a thin wire (<i>g</i> and <i>g'</i>) having a considerable
resistance, about 1000 ohms, being connected direct to the earth
plates <i>e</i> and <i>e'</i>, and the other a thick wire (<i>h</i> and <i>h'</i>) offering a very
small resistance, and so arranged that when the armature is attracted,
they may be in contact with and complete the circuit through the
armature to earth.</p>

<p>The thin wire coils are so arranged that a certain number of
Leclanché cells (ten or twelve, as may be desired) will make the
electro magnets act, while with fewer cells the current would be too
weak, and would therefore pass through them to earth without affecting
the armature.</p>

<p>By means of the three-coil galvanometer, a table of the deflections,
obtained by the foregoing system of testing, should be carefully recorded,
when the circuit is known to be in good working order, so that
any defect in the circuit would be at once indicated on the application
of the various tests, by the results so obtained differing from those
originally recorded. When a system of submarine mines is placed in
position for the purposes of practice and experiment, every trouble
should be taken to endeavour to fix the exact position of any defect
that may exist, also to ascertain its magnitude, &amp;c., but in time of war,
should a defect exist in the system, no time must be lost in such
operations, but the mine at once lifted, and the fault repaired, or a
fresh one laid in its place, unless the presence of an enemy or other
imperative cause should prevent such work being done.</p>

it is desired to put the system of mines in connection with the table,
in a state of preparation to be fired by the contact of a vessel, a plug
is inserted between the contact plates <i>b</i> and <i>f</i>, and the current passes
through the galvanometer <i>g</i>, and electrically charges the conducting
wires connecting the mines with the battery, through the several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
binding screws on the contact plates, numbering 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. The
fact that the charge has been fired is also at once indicated on the
galvanometer <i>g</i>.</p>

<p><i>Test to discover an Exploded Charge.</i>&mdash;It then becomes necessary
to ascertain which particular mine of the system has been exploded;
for this purpose a separate circuit in connection with a single cell <i>d</i> is
employed. This cell is in connection through a galvanometer <i>g'</i> (a
more sensitive instrument than the galvanometer <i>g</i>) with the pivot of
the key <i>h</i>, and rheotome <i>R</i>, which latter is connected, as shown by
the dotted lines, with each individual mine of the system attached to
the contact plates numbered 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. The handle of the rheotome
is moved round, to each number in succession and directly it is placed
in contact with that corresponding to the exploding mine, the
electrical circuit is completed through the exposed end of the
fractured wire, and this is indicated by the galvanometer <i>g'</i>. During
the testing process the firing battery <i>c z</i> must be disconnected; this is
done by raising one of the bridges <i>i i</i> with which each group of ten
mines is provided.</p>

<p><i>Insulation Test.</i>&mdash;The rheotome and testing galvanometer <i>g'</i> are
also used to test the insulation of the electric cables connecting the
mines to the testing table. This is done in precisely the same
manner as testing for an exploded mine: the handle of the rheotome
is turned round, and each cable connected in succession with the
testing circuit as before; should the galvanometer <i>g'</i> remain stationary,
the insulation is good; but should a defect of insulation exist, the
current passing through it would act on and deflect the galvanometer,
indicating the particular line in which it exists, and, roughly, its
extent in proportion to the deflection shown; should the fault be
considerable, the defective cable should be at once detached, as the
current lost through it might so diminish the working power of the
firing battery, as to prevent it exploding any of the fuzes attached to
the group in connection with it. By the above arrangement, the
insulation of each line can be tested at any moment required.</p>

<p>In making the delicate test for insulation, which should invariably
be done at leisure, and, if possible, when an enemy's vessels are not in
the vicinity of the mines, a large number of Daniell's or other cells of
suitable form should always be used. To do this, it would only be
necessary to connect such a battery in place of a single cell permanently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
arranged, as described, in the testing circuit, and to
proceed with the details of the operation as before. As the cable
would, in actual work, always be charged with the full power of a
firing battery, the value of its insulation to resist an electrical charge
at such a high potential would be an important point to determine.
The fuzes being entirely out of the circuit till the moment of the
action arrives, no danger of a premature explosion need be apprehended;
if a fuze were in such a position as to be fired prematurely,
it would be exploded, in connection with the firing circuit, independently
of the operation of testing the insulation of the cables.</p>

<p><i>To render a Channel Safe.</i>&mdash;In order to render the channel safe
for a friendly vessel, it is only necessary to remove the plug from
between the contact plates <i>b</i> and <i>f</i>; this disconnects the firing battery
from the circuit.</p>

<p><i>Defence of Harbours by Booms, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Booms or cables supported by
rafts may also be employed in the defence of harbours, or rivers, either
by themselves, or in combination with submarine mines; in the latter
case, the booms, &amp;c., may be moored either in advance of the mines, or
in rear of the front row, this last method of mooring them being the
most effective one.</p>

<p>There are a great variety of forms in which a boom may be constructed.
The qualities essential for a good and practicable boom are:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;Great strength.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;Great power of resistance.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;Convenience in handling.</li>
<li>4.&mdash;Easy to manipulate.</li>
<li>5.&mdash;Its materials easily procurable.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Construction of a Boom.</i>&mdash;The general construction of a boom consists
of a main cable, buoyed up at intervals by floats. The main cable
may be either wire, chain, or rope, the former being very much superior
for this purpose to chain or rope. The floats consist of balks of timber
built round the main cable and bound together by means of iron hoops
&amp;c. A space is left between each float, by which a certain amount
of flexibility in the boom is obtained, without which it would be of
comparatively little use, as it might be easily overrun.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind, in constructing all such booms, that the
smaller the proportion of timber used in forming the floats to the
cable, consistent with buoyancy, the stronger will be the structure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>A very important feature in connection with such a mode of defence
is the manner of mooring it; for if it be moored so as to be
unyielding, then its sole power of resisting a vessel charging it is
the actual strength of the materials composing the structure, but if it
be moored so that it is capable of yielding to a sudden blow, this force
will be to some extent absorbed, and resistance of the defence greatly
increased.</p>

<p>The raft employed to support the main cable should be moored by
means of very heavy chains (without anchors) in the direction of the
attack, and with ordinary anchors and cables on the other side.</p>

<p>As a rule, the booms should be moored obliquely to the direction of
the current, where there is any, as the tendency of the current to overrun
the boom when so placed will be less, and also a ship ramming it
must place herself athwart the current to attack the boom at right
angles.</p>

<p><i>Clearing a Passage through the Torpedo Defences of an Enemy.</i>&mdash;The
subject of clearing a passage through the torpedo defences of an enemy
is one fraught with innumerable difficulties, on account of the varied
nature and impracticability of obtaining accurate and <i>certain</i> information
of such defences, and thus it is impossible to lay down any fixed
rule or plan for carrying out such an operation.</p>

<p>In fact, it will be only under the most favourable circumstances that
such a service will be successfully accomplished, that is to say, in the
case of a harbour or river defended by submarine mines but unsupported
by guns, or guard boats, or where the electric light is used.</p>

<p>Numerous methods have been devised from time to time to effect
the destruction of an enemy's submarine defences, among which are
the following:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;Projecting frames, &amp;c., from the bows of a vessel.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;Creeping and sweeping by boats.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;Countermining.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Projecting Frames, &amp;c., from the Bows of a Vessel.</i>&mdash;This method was
adopted by the Federals during the American civil war of 1861-5,
and in many instances it was the means of saving their ships when
proceeding up rivers which had been torpedoed by the Confederates,
though notwithstanding this precaution several vessels were sunk.
The submarine mines against which this mode of defence was used,
were in nine cases out of ten mechanical ones, and therefore the framework<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
defence afforded a better means of protection then, than would be
the case now that electrical ground mines and circuit closers are used,
as the framework would catch the circuit closer only, and the vessel
would probably be over the mine when the explosion took place. The
Americans moor their circuit closers in rear of their mines, so that a
vessel fitted with a bow frame or not, coming in contact with the
former must be right over the charge at the instant of explosion.</p>

<p>Against ground electrical mines fired at will, the bow net, &amp;c., is no
protection whatever, still under certain circumstances it would be found
extremely useful.</p>

<p><i>Sweeping for Submarine Mines.</i>&mdash;This method of clearing a channel
of submarine mines could not possibly be carried out under artillery
fire, but in waters not so defended it would prove of some value.</p>

<p>Where only buoyant mines, or ground mines with circuit closers are
to be cleared away, two or more boats dragging a hawser between them
would be sufficient to discover them, and so lead to their destruction;
but where dummy mines and inverted creepers are moored in addition,
another method of sweeping must be resorted to, viz., that of bringing
an explosive charge of gun-cotton to act on the obstruction grappled,
and thus destroy it. This is effected by lashing a charge to each end
of the sweep, so that whatever is grappled may slide along it, until
caught by hooks, which are attached for this purpose to the centre of
the charge. On grappling an obstruction, the two boats drop their
anchors, one hauling in, the other veering out the sweep, until the
charge is hooked by the obstruction; this being effected, the boats
move out of range, and the charge is fired.</p>

<p><i>Creeping for Electrical Cables, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Creeping is the method employed
for picking up the electric cables of the enemy's submarine mines, and
is effected by boats towing an ordinary grappling iron, or specially
prepared creeper on the ground.</p>

<p>In both sweeping and creeping it would be found necessary to
employ a diver, who would ascertain the nature of the grappled
obstructions which could not be easily raised by the boats.</p>

<p>The Lay torpedo boat, which is fully described in the chapter
on offensive torpedoes, is capable of being used for the foregoing
purposes.</p>

<p><i>Countermining.</i>&mdash;Countermining, that is, the destruction of submarine
mines by the explosion of other mines dropped close to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
will under certain conditions prove of great use in clearing harbours of
mines. This method could not be operated in waters properly guarded
and swept by artillery fire.</p>

<p>There are two distinct methods of laying out countermines, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;In a boat, which may be either towed, or hauled out to its
destination, or may be steered, and controlled by electricity.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;By attaching them to buoys so that they are suspended at
the proper depths, and then hauled out by means of a
warp to an anchor which has been previously placed in
position.</div>

<p>Both of the foregoing methods have been successfully manipulated
in practice, the first method, where the boat carrying the countermines
is towed either by a pulling or steam boat being the most practicable
one. A large amount of material would be required for clearing a
channel by means of countermines: for example, if the mines to
be attacked require 500-lb. gun-cotton charges to be used, 7-1/2 tons
of the explosive, besides cables, buoys, &amp;c., would be required to clear
a passage about one mile in length and 200 feet in width.</p>

<p>A ship's launch will carry about twelve of these 500-lb. countermines,
with all the gear attached thereto.</p>

<p>Experiments to ascertain the effect of countermining have been
carried out in England and Europe for the last five years, some of
which are given at length in the chapter on "Torpedo Experiments."
During the Turco-Russian war, a portion of the Danube was swept in
the ordinary and most simple manner by the Turks, and five Russian
electro contact buoyant mines were picked up; one other exploded
during the process of dragging it to the surface, but no injury occurred
to those at work.</p>

<p><i>Destruction of Passive Obstructions.</i>&mdash;To clear away booms, or other
passive obstructions, if not possible to cut them away, they may be
destroyed by outrigger boats exploding their torpedoes underneath,
and in contact, or by attaching charges of gun-cotton at intervals, and
then exploding them simultaneously. When a chain is horizontal,
and therefore somewhat taut, a charge of 3-1/2 lbs. of gun-cotton (this
explosive, being the most effective and convenient for such purposes,
should always be used) will be found sufficient to destroy it, no matter
what size, and whether the chain is in or out of the water, the charge
being of course placed in contact with it. Great uncertainty must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
always attend the supposed clearance of a channel, or passage of
submarine mines, as was exemplified during the American civil war,
when most of the Northerners' vessels were destroyed while moving
over ground which had been previously carefully dragged, and buoyed,
and this fact, coupled with the tediousness and danger of performing
such a service, proves the enormous value of a system of defence by
submarine mines.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<small>OFFENSIVE TORPEDO WARFARE.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE term "Torpedo" is applicable more particularly to offensive
submarine mines than to those employed for the purposes of
defence, and therefore by <i>torpedoes</i> will be understood every kind of
submarine explosive weapon designed to be used for active attack
against vessels, &amp;c., no matter how they may be manipulated.</div>

<p><i>Offensive Torpedo Warfare still in its Infancy.</i>&mdash;Though during the
seventeen or eighteen years that torpedoes have been considered as a
legitimate mode of naval warfare there have occurred three big wars,
in each of which submarine weapons, offensive and defensive, have
played an important part, still the subject of <i>offensive</i> torpedo warfare
must be even now considered as in its infancy, and therefore any
opinions expressed as to the merits and demerits of the various
apparatus in connection therewith can but be based on the theoretical
capabilities of each torpedo, and on the results of experiments carried
out with them during peace time, which latter as a rule are conducted
under far too favourable conditions to be relied upon.</p>

<p><i>Their Use during the Civil War in America.</i>&mdash;During the American
civil war, the only offensive submarine weapon that was used was the
outrigger or spar torpedo, which in those days was a crude and
imperfect machine, and man&oelig;uvred from boats possessing all the
features which a torpedo boat should <i>not</i> possess. Still under these
unfavourable conditions ships were sunk by such means by both
Federals and Confederates, proving that in future wars this mode of
attack, favoured by the vast and important improvements that have
lately been effected both in connection with the torpedoes and torpedo
boats, should play a prominent part, and prove a most destructive
mode of attack.</p>

<p><i>Their Use in the Franco-German and Russo-Turkish Wars.</i>&mdash;In the
Franco-German war of 1870-1, offensive torpedo warfare was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
resorted to by either side, the French fleet being deterred from
entering German waters by the submarine mines placed, or at least
supposed to be placed, in position.</p>

<p>From the Russo-Turkish war much light was expected by
torpedoists to be thrown on the subject of torpedo warfare, but alas,
little or nothing was done to settle any of the many vexed questions
which exist in regard to offensive submarine weapons. The torpedo
experience of that struggle tended rather to prove that the vast
importance hitherto attached to torpedo attack was much exaggerated.</p>

<p>One of the causes which led to the failure of offensive submarine
weapons, when employed on active service, seems to be due to the fact
that, owing to the extremely small radius of the destructive effect of
such weapons, it is absolutely necessary for complete success to explode
the mine in actual contact with the attacked vessel; to ensure which,
at night time, in an unknown harbour, with the position of the vessel
attacked somewhat uncertain, and even without the additional
obstacles of guard boats, booms, electric lights, &amp;c., is a service of
infinite difficulty, and one which may easily terminate in a failure. The
foregoing would more especially apply to the spar torpedo attack, but
in an attack with the Whitehead fish, or towing torpedo, there would
be an additional cause of failure, viz., the complicated nature of their
manipulation.</p>

<p>Torpedoes may be divided into four classes, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;Drifting or floating torpedoes.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;Towing torpedoes.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;Locomotive torpedoes.</li>
<li>4.&mdash;Outrigger or spar torpedoes.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Drifting or Floating Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;By "drifting" or "floating"
torpedoes are meant all those submarine machines which are dependent
on the tide or current of a stream for their action and motion.</p>

<p>During the American civil war this mode of attacking vessels was
constantly employed by the Confederates, and though not successful
in destroying any of the Federal ships, was the means of considerably
hampering the movements of their river flotillas.</p>

<p>Drifting torpedoes might be advantageously used for the destruction
of pontoon bridges, booms, &amp;c., and in this way, had the Turks in
their late war used them, the Russians would have found the crossing
of the Danube a matter of infinite danger and difficulty; in fact, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a systematic use of such weapons, combined with a little dash on the
part of the Ottoman flotilla on the Danube, that river should have
been to the Russians an impassable barrier. To use these torpedoes
most effectively, especially against a single vessel, a thorough knowledge
of the force and direction of currents should be gained before
proceeding to undertake an operation in which these submarine
weapons are used.</p>

<p>Another point to be remembered is, that if such a torpedo were
started with the flood, for example, towards an enemy, and did not
explode, there would be a chance of its being returned to the starting-place
by the ebb tide.</p>

<p>In this class the following torpedoes seem the most practicable:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;Lewis's drifting torpedo.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;McEvoy's drifting torpedo.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;American extempore drifting torpedo.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Description of Lewis's Drifting Torpedo.</i>&mdash;"Lewis's" drifting
torpedo, designed for the express purpose of destroying booms or
other floating obstructions placed round a vessel at anchor for the
purposes of defence, is shown at <a href="#Fig_101">Fig. 101</a>. It consists of a box <i>a</i>,
containing the charge and fitted with several detonating fuzes. This
box is attached to one side of a beam <i>b</i>, and within 6 inches of one
extremity, the beam being about 20 feet long and 7 inches square;
to the opposite side, of the same end of the beam <i>b</i> a heavy weight
<i>c</i>, resting in a shoe <i>d</i>, is attached by a long iron rod <i>e</i>, which reaches
to the other extremity of the beam, and is there connected to a bell-crank
lever and spring <i>f</i>, a pressure on which detaches the weight
<i>c</i>; a chain <i>g</i>, 18 feet long, connects the weight loosely with the
upper end of the beam, and another chain <i>h</i>, 9 feet 6 inches long,
connects it with a point more than 2 feet below the centre of the
beam. The apparatus is so constructed that it floats nearly vertical
with the top of the beam just above the surface of the water.</p>

<p>On the machine drifting against the boom or other obstruction,
the spring or lever <i>f</i> at the upper extremity is pressed down, thus
releasing the weight <i>c</i>, which falling, becomes suspended by the two
chains <i>g</i> and <i>h</i>, and brings the beam into an inclined position. The
weight of this mass of iron and the chain suspending it are suddenly
brought to bear on the top of the beam, dragging it under water and
clear of the boom, &amp;c. At the same time the lower end, released from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the weight, rises, and the whole apparatus is carried forward by the
current against the side of the vessel, on striking which the torpedo
is exploded.</p>

<p><i>Description of McEvoy's Drifting Torpedo.</i>&mdash;"McEvoy's" drifting
torpedo is intended to be floated, singly or in groups, by the aid of
tides or currents against vessels at anchor, bridges, &amp;c.</p>

<p>At <a href="#Fig_102">Fig. 102</a> is shown a plan of this form of drifting torpedo.</p>

<p>It consists of the body of the torpedo <i>a</i>, which contains the charge,
at the side of which is placed the loading hole <i>b</i>; <i>c</i> is the tube containing
the priming charge; <i>d</i> is the framework surrounding and
protecting the wheel or screw <i>e</i>; <i>f</i> is the fuze pillar, in the centre of
which is a steel rod <i>g</i>, and on the top a thin steel plate <i>h</i> is placed;
<i>i</i> is the nipple for the percussion cap; <i>k</i> is a horizontal bar, turning
and resting on top of the fuze pillar <i>f</i>; <i>m</i> is the lever for supporting
the hammer <i>n</i> when it is set; <i>l</i> is the screw barrel supporting the
wheel or screw <i>e</i>; <i>o</i> is a safety pin; <i>q</i> is the supporting chain, and <i>p</i>
the spring for working the hammer <i>n</i>.</p>

<p>By means of a buoy or log of wood, from which the torpedo is
suspended, it can be adjusted so that the explosion shall occur at the
requisite depth.</p>

<p>To prepare the torpedo for use, unscrew the fuze pillar <i>f</i>, take off
the horizontal bar <i>k</i>, place a percussion cup on the nipple <i>i</i>, and
screw it tightly against the end of the steel rod <i>g</i>. The fuze pillar
is then ready for use, and should be screwed into the body <i>a</i>. Then
fill the torpedo with the explosive and close the loading hole <i>b</i>. The
hammer <i>n</i> is then set by drawing it back and bringing the end of the
lever <i>m</i> against it, at the same time running the screw barrel <i>l</i> under
the lever <i>m</i>, so that its end catches the screw of the barrel, as shown
in the figure. The safety pin <i>o</i> is then put in its place and secured
by a few parts of thread, which by a sharp jerk on the safety line
will be easily broken.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a id="Fig_103"></a><a id="Fig_102"></a><a id="Fig_101"></a>
<div class="caption"><a href="images/i_190-big.jpg">DRIFTING TORPEDOES.</a></div>
<img src="images/i_190.jpg" width="500" height="803" alt="Plate XXIX" /><a id="Plate_XXIX"></a>
</div>

<p>The horizontal lever <i>k</i>, which carries the lever <i>m</i> and propeller <i>e</i>,
rotates on the top of the fuze pillar <i>f</i>, and is prevented from rising by
means of a screw. The torpedo being let go, the safety pin <i>o</i> is pulled
out by means of a line which is attached to it. The propeller will not
revolve whilst the torpedo is drifting with the current, but the instant
it is stopped by the action of the current the wheel will be caused to
revolve, and after a few revolutions it will unscrew the barrel from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
under the end of the lever <i>k</i>, and the latter, dropping the hammer <i>n</i>, will
be forced by the spring <i>p</i> into contact with the thin steel plate <i>h</i> on the
top of the fuze pillar, which blow is transmitted by means of the steel
rod <i>g</i> to the percussion cap, and the torpedo exploded.</p>

<p><i>American Extempore Drifting Torpedo.</i>&mdash;This form of drifting
torpedo, which is readily made, was used in great numbers by the
Confederates, and though not successful in sinking any Federal ships,
caused their vessels considerable annoyance and delay.</p>

<p>At <a href="#Fig_103">Fig. 103</a> is shown a sketch of this torpedo. It consists of a
tin case containing about 70 lbs. of powder. A stiff wire <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> passes
through a hole punctured in a strip of tin <i>c</i>, and a stuffing box <i>d</i>;
the end <i>a</i> of the wire is covered with fulminate, and so arranged that
the friction caused by its passage through the strip of tin <i>c</i> will ignite
it; a number of wires lead from <i>b</i> to pieces of driftwood on the surface
<i>e</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>e</i>, and the case is supported at the proper depth by a line attached
to a section of log.</p>

<p><i>Towing Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;By towing torpedoes are meant those submarine
machines which are so shaped and arranged, that when towed from a
ship or boat in motion they will diverge to a considerable extent,
thus enabling the towing vessel to pass clear of the ship attacked, and
yet near enough to allow of the torpedo being brought in contact
with some part or other of her hull.</p>

<p>Towing torpedoes were for the first time employed on actual service
during the late Russo-Turkish war, when a modified form of the well-known
Harvey torpedo, designed by a German officer, was used by
the Russians, but in no case was it successful.</p>

<p>In this class of submarine offensive machines may be placed the
following:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;Harvey's towing torpedo.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;Menzing's towing torpedo.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;The French towing torpedo.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Harvey's Torpedo.</i>&mdash;This form of towing torpedo was invented conjointly
by Captain John Harvey and Commander Frederick Harvey,
R.N., and is intended to be used at sea both as a means of offence and
defence.</p>

<p>At <a href="#Fig_104">Fig. 104</a> is shown in elevation the small sized Harvey towing
torpedo, in which all the latest improvements that have been devised
are represented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p><i>a</i> is the case of the torpedo, formed of Muntz's metal, but not
provided, as the original ones were, with an exterior case of wood; by
this alteration greater capacity combined with extreme lightness is
obtained, which undoubtedly much enhances the value of the small
size torpedo which is intended to be carried by and man&oelig;uvred from
boats; <i>b</i> is the principal or after lever, hinged on the top of torpedo
at <i>c</i>, and rests, when ready for action, in a crutch formed in the top of
the exploding bolt <i>d</i>; <i>e</i> is the foremost lever, hinged at <i>f</i>, and kept in
position on the after lever <i>b</i> by a groove formed in it and a lashing
which passes through a slot in the principal lever, as at <i>g</i>; <i>h</i> is the
side lever, pivoted at <i>i</i>, and exerting a pressure on the firing bolt <i>d</i>
by means of a lanyard which is passed through the bolt <i>k</i> and over
the principal lever <i>b</i>; <i>l</i> is the top lever, pivoted at <i>m</i>, and exerting
a pressure on the bolt <i>d</i> by means of a lanyard which is passed
through the bolt <i>n</i> and over the principal lever <i>b</i>; this top lever
<i>l</i> has been added to ensure the action of the torpedo, on its striking
sideways against a vessel; <i>o</i> and <i>t</i> are handles, to the former of
which the lashings of the levers <i>h</i> and <i>l</i> are secured; <i>p</i> is the ring
used for attaching the buoy rope; <i>r</i>, <i>r</i> are two loading holes, made in
the side of the torpedo case, by which a charge of gun-cotton may be
quickly and efficiently stowed; this also is a new feature in the small
size torpedo; <i>s</i> is the rudder formed for the purpose of controlling the
direction of the torpedo when the tow line is suddenly slacked.</p>

<p>In regard to the large size torpedo, the construction of the case
remains as in the original ones, the improvements being, the enlargement
of the loading and fuze holes, and the addition of the top lever
<i>l</i>, as shown at <a href="#Fig_104">Fig. 104</a>.</p>

<p>The small size torpedo is capable of holding 47 lbs. of water,
whilst the large size one will contain 76 lbs. of water, or about 33 lbs.
and 58 lbs. of gun-cotton respectively.</p>

<p>The slings are made of best Italian hemp, and consist of a span
of four legs, which are secured to lugs at the corners of the torpedo
and connected to an iron thimble, which is shown at Fig. 105; this
thimble is made suitable for either wire or hemp rope, and is so
arranged that should the seizing become slack, the parts of the slings
cannot become detached from the thimble.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_104"></a>
<div class="caption"><a href="images/i_194-big.jpg">HARVEY'S TOWING TORPEDO.</a></div>
<img src="images/i_194.jpg" width="600" height="379" alt="Plate XXX" /><a id="Plate_XXX"></a>
</div>

<p>The legs of the slings should be so fitted that when stretched
alongside the torpedo they extend 1 foot beyond the stem for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
large torpedo and 8 inches for the small one; the four legs should be
so fitted that when an equal strain is brought on them, the thimble
should be on a level with the upper lugs, and the upper fore span
form an angle of 80° to 85° with the side of the torpedo; this is shown
at <a href="#Fig_106">Fig. 106</a>. This arrangement gives the best divergence with the
least strain on the tow rope, and is suitable when the torpedo is kept
at short scope, as well as when a long length of tow line is out.</p>

<p>The mode of attaching the foremost and side levers is shown at
<a href="#Fig_107">Fig. 107</a>. Before reeving the lanyards they should be well greased
in the wake of the fair leads, but not where they are made fast. The
lanyards should be made up like a reef point. Care should be taken
that the short arm of the side lever <i>h</i> is brought close into the fair
lead, and its lanyard should be set up sufficiently taut to give a slight
spring in the principal lever <i>b</i> by the strain thus brought on it. This
lever <i>b</i> has a steel fish on the top, in order to prevent it taking a
permanent bend. If the side lever lanyard is properly set up, the
bolt will spring down about 1/8th of an inch when the safety key is
withdrawn, owing to the spring in the lever, and the shrinking of the
lanyard; this brings the muzzle 1/8th of an inch nearer the pin without
disturbing the side lever.</p>

<p>The bolt is so arranged that the torpedo can be fired by either of
the following methods:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;Mechanically.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;Electrically at will.</li>
<li>3.&mdash;Electrically on contact or at will.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Mechanically.</i>&mdash;In this case the bottom of the inner cylinder, as at
<i>a</i>, <a href="#Fig_108">Fig. 108</a>, is fitted with the ordinary mechanical chemical fuze,
ignition being effected by the breaking of the glass vessel containing
the sulphuric acid on being forced into contact with the needle <i>n</i>, by
the action of the levers on the torpedo striking a vessel.</p>

<p><i>Electrically at Will.</i>&mdash;For this purpose a platinum wire fuze is used,
one terminal being connected to earth through the bolt, the other to
a wire leading up through the core of the bolt, and connected by
means of an ebonite joint with a single cored electrical cable leading
from the torpedo vessel.</p>

<p><i>Electrically on Contact, or at Will.</i>&mdash;In this case, a resistance coil is
inserted in addition to the fuze, and is so arranged that on the bolt
being forced down a short circuit is formed, cutting out the resistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
coil (about 20 ohms), and thus enabling the battery to fire the fuze,
which, owing to the 20 ohms resistance in the circuit, it was previously
unable to effect. Should the bolt so arranged be required to be fired
at will, it is only necessary to put a more powerful battery in circuit,
and so fire the fuze through the 20 ohms resistance.</p>

<p><i>Exploding Bolt.</i>&mdash;The exploding bolt is fitted to act with a pressure
of from 30 to 40 lbs. on its head for the large size torpedo, and from
15 to 20 lbs. for the small size one.</p>

<p>The bolts are all the same size, and differ only in the direction of
the slot for the safety key <i>k</i>, being port or starboard bolts accordingly.
The muzzle of the exploding bolt stands 1 inch off the pin when in
the safety position, that is, when the safety key rests on the brass work
of the priming case.</p>

<p>The safety key is secured in the slot of the exploding bolt, as shown
at <a href="#Fig_108">Fig. 108</a>, by eight or nine parts of strong whitey-brown thread
secured to the key, passed round the bolt, and securely knotted; the
parts of the thread should come away with the key, in order that
none of the parts may be worked down the tube by the exploding bolt.</p>

<p>In the event of the large torpedo being cut away in deep water
after the withdrawal of the safety key, it will explode by pressure on
the head of the bolt at about sixty fathoms depth; the small one at
about thirty fathoms.</p>

<p><i>Buoys.</i>&mdash;The buoys are of two sizes, and are made of solid cork
(such cork only being used as will ensure great floating power after
being immersed for a time); each buoy is built upon a galvanised
iron tube running longitudinally through; on the ends of the tube
are screwed wooden cones, which bind all together, and render the
buoy indestructible.</p>

<p>Two buoys are used for each torpedo, the larger buoys for the
large size torpedo, and the smaller buoys for the small size torpedo.
The buoy rope is of hemp, about five or six fathoms in length and
two inches in circumference, an eye being spliced in the end nearest
the torpedo; to this eye is bent the tow rope, with a single or double
sheet bend forming the knot by which the torpedo is towed; the
other end of the buoy rope is passed through one of the rings in the
stern end of the torpedo (according to whether working in deep or
shallow water), then through the tube of the first buoy, and an overhand
knot made in the rear; then through the next buoy, and a knot in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
rear of that. Recently, Captain Harvey has adopted a large and a
small buoy for each torpedo, the large one being practically sufficient,
the smaller one being added in the event of the other one becoming
sodden.</p>

<p><i>Brakes.</i>&mdash;The brakes are used for the purpose of controlling the
tow ropes; they can be fixed by screws into the deck at the most
convenient place for command, and in a properly constructed torpedo
vessel would be placed below the water line, to prevent exposure of the
men working them. They are so arranged as to admit of the tow rope
being quickly veered, and at the same time are sufficiently powerful to
bring the torpedo to the surface when required. Success greatly
depends on the skilful handling of these brakes, for in conjunction
with the cork buoys they give the operator command of the depth at
which the enemy is to be struck. Unless a very high rate of speed is
required, one handspike will control the tow rope; the other strap can
be thrown off the drum, and the handspike allowed to lie on the deck
ready to be thrown into gear, if necessary. The surface of the drum
in contact with the strap should be powdered with rosin to increase
the friction. The tow rope should be so reeled up that in veering the
reel may revolve towards the men at the handspike. The spindle will
contain several tow ropes, that, in the event of one torpedo being cut
away, another can be immediately bent.</p>

<p>The brake for small torpedo requires only one drum and handspike.
It can be fitted to a steam launch by placing an extra thwart
across near one of the others.</p>

<p>Care should be taken that the riding turns lie fairly over each
other, to prevent a jamb when veering.</p>

<p>The brakes, both large and small, are so made as to ensure
durability, they being considered a part of the ship's furniture.</p>

<p>Brake for safety key line is a small reel on the same principle.
When going a slow speed, it may not be necessary, as the safety key
line can be attended by hand; but when going ten or eleven knots,
it will be found of considerable advantage, both in keeping the bight
of the safety key line from dragging astern, thereby lessening the
divergence of the torpedo, and also in drawing the safety key when a
strong stop is used.</p>

<p><i>Arrangements for Launching and Towing the Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;A yard across
either the main or mizen mast of a torpedo vessel, from 20 to 25 feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
above the water line, is a very convenient method for launching and
towing. The leading block on the yard, through which the tow rope
is rove, may be fitted to a traveller on the yard with an inhaul and
outhaul, that the distance out from the ship's side may be regulated
as convenient.</p>

<p>In a large vessel, the leading block for tow rope can be fixed to
the end of the quarter-boat's davits. The brakes for commanding the
tow rope should be screwed firmly to the deck. In a vessel properly
constructed for the service, they would be on the lower deck, the tow
rope having been led along the yard, and down each side of the mast.</p>

<p>A leading block for the tow rope is placed on the deck by span
or bolt a few feet in front of the brake. The safety key reel, if
used, must be fixed in a convenient position on deck, that the man
attending it can see how to control it; in a properly constructed vessel
he would be in the pilot house. The safety key line leads through a
small leading block on the ensign staff or some convenient point abaft
the lead of the tow rope, 15 to 20 feet above the water. The leading
block on the yard may be fitted with a lizard, if thought necessary.
A sharp instrument should be kept by the brakes ready to sever the
tow rope.</p>

<p>In large men of war, arrangements are made for carrying a loaded
torpedo and two buoys in a convenient position on each side of the
vessel, in such a manner that the tow line can be bent, the exploding
bolt screwed in, the levers adjusted, and the torpedoes and buoys
dropped simultaneously when required.</p>

<p><i>Preparing the Torpedoes for Use.</i>&mdash;The torpedoes, port and starboard,
loaded and ballasted, having been hoisted out of the torpedo room, are
placed on the deck on their own sides, with their heads forward under
the leading block, and the buoys placed abaft them and strung
together; the exploding bolts are now entered into the torpedoes, and
forced down until their safety keys rest on the brass work, taking care
that each safety key points in the direction of the eye through which
its lanyard has to pass; the levers are now secured by their lanyards,
as explained at pages 120 and 121. The eye at the end of the buoy
rope is now rove through the large or small ring in the stern end of
the torpedo. The tow rope having been previously rove through the
leading block on the deck and on the yard, is rove through the thimble
of the slings from forward aft, and bent, with a single or double sheet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
bend, to the eye of the buoy rope. The safety key line having been
previously rove through the leading block on the ensign staff, and the
lanyard on the safety key having been led through the eye of the
handle, making a fair lead with the slit in the bolt, are bent together
with a double sheet bend, and stopped to the eye of the handle by a
split yarn of suitable strength, the yarn having been first secured to
the line by a round turn outside the bend.</p>

<p>The line should also be stopped with another split yarn round all
parts of the slings close up to the thimble, having first made an overhand
knot in the line at a distance a few inches longer than that
between the eye bolt and the thimble.</p>

<p>The crew having been stationed at their respective posts, the
handles having been shipped on the tow reel, the tow line is then
reeled up until the torpedo will launch clear, and swing out under the
leading block on the yard. Hold the torpedo by the handspikes, and
take off the handles of the brake. In swinging out, care should be
taken that in starting from the deck the fore slings do not foul the
fore top lever. The stern of the torpedo can be steadied by keeping a
slight strain on the buoy rope. The safety key line must be kept
clear, and not checked, or it might break the stop and draw out the
key before intended. The buoys must be placed in a proper position
and hands stationed by them to launch them overboard the instant the
torpedo takes the water. It would be better to stop the screw, if
circumstances would allow of it, when lowering the torpedo and buoys
into the water, to prevent the chance of the buoys fouling the screw.
The torpedo, on reaching the water, will <i>immediately</i> diverge clear of
the ship; the buoys being launched, as the strain comes on the buoy
rope, they will be towed clear away from the screw, and full speed may
be put on at once. The men at the handspikes must veer steadily,
occasionally checking the torpedo, that it may be kept near the surface,
and not allowed to dive, which it will do if the tow rope is slacked up
altogether, and then a sudden strain brought on it.</p>

<p>Eventually it will come to the surface, when the bow is pointed up
by the strain on the tow rope; greater the speed the more quickly will
it be brought to the surface. In shallow water this should be particularly
attended to, as in diving it might strike the bottom and injure
the levers, and, if the safety key has been withdrawn, explode; moreover,
it brings an undue strain on the tow rope. The torpedo can now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
be gradually veered out to the distance required, the safety key line so
attended that a sufficient strain is kept on it as not to allow of a long
bight of line dragging astern of the torpedo; at the same time having
due regard to the strength of the yarn by which the line is stopped to
the handle of the torpedo. The distance veered must depend upon the
nature of attack. The tow line should be marked with knots every
10 fathoms: under some circumstances the torpedo would be close
to the ship until passing the enemy; at other times veered to 40
fathoms it will be found most suitable.</p>

<p>The full divergence of 45° is obtained up to 50 fathoms; beyond
that the bight of the tow rope in the water drags the torpedo astern,
unless the tow rope is triced much higher up, which has its disadvantage;
40 to 50 fathoms of tow rope gives the best command of the torpedo,
veering 2 or 3 fathoms of tow line suddenly will always sink the torpedo
some feet below the surface. Should it become necessary to use the
torpedoes with a stern board, they can be so used, but in this case the
port torpedo is used on the starboard, bow and starboard on the port;
all other arrangements being exactly the same. In rough weather,
advantage should be taken of the roll, and the torpedo allowed to
swing out from the yard, and be let go by the run, checking the tow rope
immediately the torpedo is in the water. It is not absolutely necessary
to ease the vessel when launching; the torpedo can be launched at full
speed. In the event of its being found necessary to cut adrift the
torpedo, in consequence of coming suddenly across a friendly vessel,
the tow rope should be cut near the brake, and if the buoy rope has
been rove through the large stern ring, the torpedo will sink and be lost,
the buoy only remaining. If the buoy rope has been rove through
the small stern ring, the torpedo will be suspended by the buoy rope;
and should the safety key not have been withdrawn, can be recovered
with safety.</p>

<p>In the event of wishing to recover it when the buoy rope has
been rove through the large ring, a toggle must be lashed on the
tow rope abaft the leading block on the yard, when it can be recovered
by the buoy rope; as a general rule, however, it will be found best to
expend the torpedo, and not attempt its recovery.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Recovering the Torpedo.</i>&mdash;Should the safety key have been withdrawn,
great caution is necessary. Tongs, shown at <a href="#Fig_109">Fig. 109</a>, for going round
the upper part of the bolt, to take the place of the safety key, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
once clasped and secured round the bolt, render the torpedo safe to
handle; this could only be done from a boat. With the safety key in,
there is no danger in hoisting it inboard again by its own tow rope, and
hoisting up the buoys at the same time with a grapnel.</p>

<p><i>Different Methods of Using the Torpedo.</i>&mdash;There are two methods of
employing the torpedo, either of which may be adopted, according to
circumstances.</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;When it is towed with a length of line varying from 25 to 60
fathoms, and dipped when in position to strike the attacked
vessel.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;When it is kept suspended from the yard, &amp;c., and dropped at
the spot, where according to the first method it would have
been dipped.</div>

<p>In the first method, it is not necessary to withdraw the safety key
till just before dipping; in the second method the safety key line is
belayed at about twenty fathoms, and the key withdrawn when the
line is tautened by the ship going ahead.</p>

<p><i>Tactics.</i>&mdash;Description of the various attacks that may be made with
the Harvey torpedo against a ship at anchor or under way. In the
following diagrams <i>T</i> is the torpedo vessel, <i>S</i> the ship attacked.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 181px;">
<img src="images/i_205.jpg" width="181" height="52" alt="The Track,  The Tow Rope The Torpedo" />
</div>

<p><i>Attacking a Vessel moored Head and Stern.</i>&mdash;In this case the torpedo
vessel steers in for the bow or quarter of the vessel attacked, according
to the direction of the current, and on the side approached launches
the torpedo between the moorings, as at <i>A</i>; leaving the tow rope slack,
the torpedo vessel proceeds ahead or astern against the current, and
when at a sufficient distance off, the tow rope is held fast, which will
cause the torpedo to diverge into contact with the vessel attacked, as
shown by <a href="#Fig_110">Fig. 110</a>.</p>

<p><i>Attacking a Vessel at Anchor by Crossing her Bow.</i>&mdash;In this case the
torpedo is sufficiently diverged when near to the vessel with a good
scope of tow rope out. After having crossed her bow, proceeding
onwards, the tow rope will be brought obliquely across her cable, and
the torpedo will swing into her, as shown at <a href="#Fig_111">Fig. 111</a>. It may be here
remarked, that in all cases the depth of the explosion can be obtained
by the sudden slacking of the tow rope; and the tow rope once under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the keel, causes the torpedo to be hauled down near to it before
exploding.</p>

<p><i>Attacking a Vessel at Anchor by coming up from Astern on either
Side.</i>&mdash;In this case the torpedo is launched when on the quarter of the
vessel attacked, as at <i>A</i>, the tow rope left slack. After steaming ahead
some distance, hold fast the tow rope, when, by continuing to steam on,
the torpedo will diverge into contact with the bottom of the vessel
attacked, as shown at <a href="#Fig_112">Fig. 112</a>. <i>When skilfully performed</i>, the total
destruction of the enemy is certain, since the torpedo is springing from
a depth to the surface, and will, in consequence, strike near her keel.
The torpedo vessel can pass at her greatest speed, and, if thought
necessary, near enough to clear away any of the ordinary obstructions,
such as booms, nets, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Passing Down between Two Lines of Vessels at Anchor.</i>&mdash;In this case
it would be impossible to fire at the torpedo vessel, for fear of injury to
their friends. Two or more torpedo vessels following each other with
preconcerted signals would cause great destruction. See <a href="#Fig_113">Fig. 113</a>.</p>

<p><i>Attacking a Vessel in Motion from Right Ahead.</i>&mdash;In this case two
torpedoes are launched, port and starboard, each diverging to its full
extent; when passing the vessel attacked, one or the other of the tow ropes
is brought across the cut-water, and by the simultaneous motion
of the two vessels in opposite directions, the torpedo is brought alongside
of or under the bottom of the vessel attacked, as shown at <a href="#Fig_114">Fig. 114</a>.
The torpedo vessel should keep the masts of her enemy in one until
close to, when either torpedo will be used, according to the movement
of the enemy. At the time of the tow rope taking the cut-water, the
brake is suddenly eased up; the tow rope will then pass under the
bottom, when by checking the tow rope the torpedo will be hauled
under the bottom.</p>

<p>To execute this attack, judgment, skill, and nerve of the highest
order will be required, as the risk of being run down will be imminent.</p>

<p><i>The Attack from Astern.</i>&mdash;In this case two torpedoes are launched,
and diverged as in the previous case; it is assumed in this instance
that the torpedo vessel can outspeed the vessel attacked, which will
enable her to bring a torpedo under the run of the attacked vessel,
as shown at <a href="#Fig_115">Fig. 115</a>.</p>

<img src="images/i_210.jpg" width="500" height="797" alt="Plate XXXIV" /><a id="Plate_XXXIV"></a>
</div>

<p><i>If Chased by a Hostile Vessel, and unable to Face her.</i>&mdash;In this case
veer a torpedo astern, having first obtained a position a little on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
bow of the chasing vessel. When it is known by the length of the
tow rope out that the torpedo is about abreast of her bow, hold fast
the tow rope, which will cause the torpedo to diverge, and be brought
into contact, as shown at <a href="#Fig_116">Fig. 116</a>. As a last resort drop spanned
torpedoes.</p>

<p>Torpedoes can be used with a stern board, if necessary. The port
torpedo, in this case, will be launched on the starboard side, and the
starboard on the port side.</p>

<p>It should be here remarked that, although great speed is essential
in the torpedo vessel to come up with the enemy and choose an advantageous
position, it is not advisable to tow the torpedoes, if it can be
avoided, at a greater speed than 11 knots; because the strain brought
upon the towing gear is excessive, and the torpedo would require a
large addition of ballast to keep it sufficiently immersed to attain the
full divergence.</p>

<p>There is, however, one style of attack in which the highest speed
can be maintained, viz. by dropping the torpedo alongside in passing.</p>

<p>This mode of attack is one of the best, particularly under cover
of darkness, against a ship at anchor.</p>

<p>The position of the torpedo is known, and the tow line is never in
contact with the enemy during the operation; a skilled hand at the
brakes is all that is required, the vessel keeping a straight course at
the highest speed, passing as close as possible to the enemy, in order
to clear away all obstructions. The tow rope must not be checked by
the brake too suddenly.</p>

<p><i>Defensive Purposes.</i>&mdash;The Harvey torpedo may be used as a means
of defence by large ships against a torpedo vessel attacking with that
species of submarine weapon, as the latter would be forced to pass
outside the former vessel's torpedo, and thus decrease the chance of a
successful dip. Again, in the case of an attack by the ram, these
torpedoes afford some protection, as a deterrent.</p>

<p><i>Night time.</i>&mdash;Though a dark night and tempestuous are favourable
to a surprise, yet in the case of a Harvey torpedo attack it is essential
that the weapon should be seen to dip it at the proper time, therefore
daylight is necessary to this species of torpedo attack.</p>

<p><i>Value of the Harvey Torpedo.</i>&mdash;The Harvey torpedo is undoubtedly
of considerable value when <i>ably handled</i>, yet the skill and judgment
required is very great, and can only be acquired by <i>constant</i> practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Description of the Menzing Towing Torpedo.</i>&mdash;This modified form of
the Harvey towing torpedo was designed by Captain Menzing, of the
German navy, to remedy what is considered by the Germans as the chief
defect of that weapon, viz. its liability to injure friendly vessels, and
also to do away with the necessity of using two torpedoes, one for
each side of a ship.</p>

<p>At <a href="#Fig_117">Fig. 117</a> is shown a plan and elevation of this towing torpedo.
<i>a</i> is the body of the torpedo, somewhat similar to the Harvey, but
narrower at the stern, and bevelled on both sides towards the bow; <i>b</i>
is an iron frame placed in the bow, capable of being turned either to
the right or left; <i>c</i> is the hole for the introduction of the fuze, and
<i>d</i> is the loading hole; <i>e</i> is a rudder placed at the stern of the torpedo;
<i>f</i>, <i>f</i> are levers, by pressure against which the torpedo may be fired
mechanically, or electrically at will; these levers are connected to a
block of wood fitted with stops to prevent them being pushed too far
over; <i>s</i> and <i>p</i> are two towing ropes, one on each side of the torpedo,
which pass from its stern through the point of the frame <i>b</i>, and thence
to the vessel, these are also connected to the rudder <i>e</i> in such a manner
that on either of the ropes <i>s</i> and <i>p</i> being tautened the rudder <i>e</i> is
turned in the opposite direction; <i>w</i> is an electric cable, strong enough
to bear the whole pressure of the torpedo when being towed right aft.</p>

<p>To diverge the torpedo on the starboard quarter of the ship, the
line <i>s</i> must be slackened, and the whole towing strain brought on the
rope <i>p</i>, causing the frame <i>b</i> to be pulled over to a knot <i>k</i> in the rope <i>p</i>,
made at the proper position to ensure the torpedo towing at the correct
angle from the course of the vessel, and at the same time causing the
rudder <i>e</i> to be turned to starboard; this is shown at <a href="#Fig_117">Fig. 117</a> by the
dotted lines.</p>

<p>To diverge the torpedo on the port quarter, the towing rope <i>p</i> would
be slackened and the whole strain brought on the rope <i>s</i>, and an action
opposite to that already described would be the result.</p>

<p>Two cork buoys are used, similar to those employed with the
Harvey torpedo; one being attached at a distance of 10 feet from the
stern of the torpedo, and the other at such a distance astern that the
torpedo would be placed at a distance below the surface to allow of
safety to a friendly vessel.</p>

<p>The torpedo is manipulated in a similar manner to the Harvey, the
circuit being closed at the moment of the first buoy disappearing, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>which time the torpedo would be about ten feet below the surface.
The two buoys are together capable of supporting the torpedo, and
thus by means of the second one it may be picked up, should it be
necessary to cut the towing ropes.</p>

<p><i>Description of the French Towing Torpedo.</i>&mdash;The towing torpedo used
by the French is represented in section and plan at <a href="#Fig_118">Fig. 118</a>.</p>

<p><i>a</i> is the body of the torpedo, formed of wood enclosed in a thin
steel case; <i>b</i> is the head made of cork; <i>c</i> is the case containing the
charge, which is generally 33 lbs. of dynamite, this case is supported
by the bolt <i>d</i> resting on the plate <i>e</i>; <i>f</i>, <i>f</i> are whiskers, which are
connected to the plate <i>e</i>; <i>g</i> and <i>h</i> are hollow tubes, one end of <i>g</i> being
attached to the case <i>e</i>, and one end of <i>h</i> to the rear end of the body
of the torpedo <i>a</i>, and they are so arranged that when the case <i>c</i> is
released, its weight will draw out the tube <i>g</i>, which slides along the
tube <i>h</i> to nearly the full extent of the latter; <i>k</i>, <i>k</i> are bolts, to which
the towing sling is attached; <i>l</i> is the fuze, and <i>n</i> is a small gun used
for firing the torpedo at will. The hole in the plate <i>e</i> through which
the bolt <i>d</i> passes is larger than the latter, so that when the plate is
moved backwards by pressure being applied to the whiskers the bolt
is freed from support, and case <i>c</i> attached to it falls.</p>

<p>The modes of firing are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;The automatic plan of firing is effected by the tube <i>h</i>, after
it has fallen a certain distance, corresponding to a depth
of 9 feet for the case <i>c</i>, drawing down by means of a line
attached to it a plug contained in the body <i>a</i>, which
completes the circuit of the firing battery.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;The plan of releasing the charge at will is effected by means
of the small gun <i>n</i>, which is fired by electricity, and by
its firing forces back the plate <i>e</i>, thus releasing the charge,
which is then exploded, as previously explained.</div>

<p><i>Locomotive Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;By "Locomotive" torpedoes are meant those
that possess within themselves the power to move through the water,
when once started in a given direction.</p>

<p>Of this species of submarine weapons, the following are the most
efficient and are the ones most generally used:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1.&mdash;The Whitehead fish torpedo.</li>
<li>2.&mdash;The Lay torpedo.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Invention and Adoption of the Fish Torpedo.</i>&mdash;The idea developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
by the fish torpedo is due to an Austrian marine artillery officer, who
is now dead. In 1864, Mr. Robert Whitehead, then superintendent of
iron works at Fiume, acting upon the suggestions of a Captain Lupuis
of the Austrian army, commenced a series of experiments to ascertain
the practical value of the above idea, the result being a fish torpedo,
commonly called "The Whitehead," which though far inferior to the
fish torpedo of the present day, was then considered to be a fearful
and wonderful weapon.</p>

<p>The Austrians were the first to purchase this weapon, and two
years later, in 1870, Mr. Whitehead came to England, and prosecuted
numerous experiments with his fish torpedo under the supervision of
several English officers, and on the 8th of October of the same year he
succeeded in completely destroying an old hulk moored at the mouth
of the Medway. The fairly successful results of these experiments
induced the English government to purchase the secret and several of
Mr. Whitehead's fish torpedoes, under the following conditions:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;The right of manufacturing them in England.</div>
<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;To be kept fully informed of all improvements, as soon as made.</div>
<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;The right of using all such improvements.</div>

<p>And the total amount paid to Mr. K. Whitehead at that time was
the sum of seventeen thousand five hundred pounds, which did not
include the sum of two thousand five hundred pounds claimed for the
expenses attendant on the Medway experiments. Since then a large
number of Whitehead's fish torpedoes have been purchased from time
to time, especially during the Turco-Russian war, when some two
hundred were ordered, also great numbers have been manufactured
at Woolwich. The English fish torpedo, as far as can be ascertained,
is a vastly superior weapon to the Whitehead fish torpedo, possessing
as it does increased speed, and therefore far greater accuracy.</p>

<p>Besides Austria and England, nearly all the European governments
have purchased the Whitehead secret and torpedoes, but in the case of
some of them, the last two clauses of the English conditions of purchase
were omitted.</p>

</div>

<p>The Turkish is the only government that has obtained the Whitehead
secret and torpedoes without paying for it. This was managed as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On the night of the 20th of December, 1877, the Russians made
an attack with Whitehead torpedoes on an Ottoman squadron lying in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the harbour of Batoum, but owing to a want of practical knowledge of
the manipulation of such weapons, no vessels were sunk or damaged,
but two fish torpedoes, one in perfect condition, were found the next
morning high and dry on the beach at that place."</p>

<p>The American government have up to the present time not
sanctioned the purchase of the costly Whitehead torpedo, preferring
their own locomotive torpedo, which will be fully described further on.
On a government purchasing the fish torpedo, a certain number of
their naval or military officers are sent to Fiume in Austria, where
Mr. R. Whitehead's manufactories are situated, and where the necessary
very exhaustive experiments with his torpedoes are carried out, and
are there thoroughly instructed in the manipulation of these machines,
and are also supplied with a double set of drawings of the various parts
of the torpedo. These officers, and all others whom it may be necessary
to initiate into the mysteries of the Whitehead secret, are bound on
their honour not to divulge it.</p>

<p><i>Employment of Fish Torpedoes in War.</i>&mdash;The fish torpedo has been
employed on actual service on three known occasions only, in two of
which it failed to fulfil its deadly mission.</p>

<p>On the 29th of May, 1877, a Whitehead fish torpedo was fired by
H.M.S. <i>Shah</i> against the Peruvian ironclad <i>Huascar</i>, but failed to strike
her, owing to the latter vessel altering her course at the moment of the
torpedo being discharged. The next instance of the employment of
the Whitehead torpedo was that one mentioned at <a href="#Page_132">page 132</a>. The last
and only successful attempt yet made occurred on the 26th of January,
1878, when the Russian steamer <i>Constantine</i> fired a Whitehead torpedo
against a Turkish guard vessel off the harbour of Batoum, and completely
destroyed her.</p>

<p><i>Description of Torpedo.</i>&mdash;A general view of the Whitehead fish
torpedo is shown at <a href="#Fig_119">Fig. 119</a>. It is divided into three parts, connected
together by screws.</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;The charge chamber.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;The adjustment chamber, in which is placed what is known as
the secret.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;The air and engine chamber.</div>

<p>Vertical and horizontal steel fins are fitted for the purpose of maintaining
the torpedo in an upright position whilst passing through the
discharge tube, or frame; the former fins run nearly the whole length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of the weapon, while the latter are considerably shorter. The motive
power of the torpedo is compressed air, forced by means of a powerful
steam air compressing pump into a portion of the steel chamber (3) at
a tension of upwards of 1000 pounds to the square inch, which is
equivalent to about sixty atmospheres, and which by means of a set
of small three cylinder Brotherhood engines, contained in the steel
chamber (3), drives two screw propellers. These engines are capable
of exerting a force of forty indicated horses, and yet only weigh about
thirty-five pounds, from which it will be understood that to attain these
results the workmanship and materials employed in their manufacture
are of the very highest order and fineness.</p>

<p>The torpedo is made of various sizes, ranging from 14' long and 14"
maximum diameter to 19' long and 16" maximum diameter.</p>

<p><i>Capabilities of the Fish Torpedo.</i>&mdash;The capabilities of the fish torpedo
are as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;If adjusted for a certain depth, from 5 to 15 feet, and projected
from above water, or if started from the surface,
or if discharged from a submerged tube, it will rapidly
attain that depth, and maintain it during the run.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;If fired in still water, it will make a straight run in the line of
projection, provided that an allowance has been made for
the deflection due to transverse currents.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;It can be adjusted to stop after having run any distance up to its
extreme range, and after stopping to sink, float, or explode.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;Its range and speed vary considerably, according to the pattern
of the torpedo.</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span><i>Placing the Charge.</i>&mdash;The explosive is generally placed in what is
termed the cartridge case, which case is similar in shape to the interior
of the charge chamber (1), and is fixed thereto by means of wooden
wedges.</p>

<p><i>Ignition.</i>&mdash;The method of ignition is mechanical, and is arranged as
follows:&mdash;Extending from the nose of the torpedo to the cartridge case
is a tube terminating in a copper case, in which is placed the priming
charge and detonating composition; within this tube is a steel rod
some 2 feet long, fitted with a needle point at its inner end, and its
outer end screwed into a frame; this frame is capable of moving in
and out, and is connected with a spiral spring which tends to force it,
and consequently the steel rod, or striker, inwards. By compressing
this spiral spring, the inner end of the frame is butted against a
catch, by which it is prevented from acting. On this catch being
released, no matter by what means, the spring is brought into action
and forces the frame and steel striker inwards, the needle point of the
latter coming into contact with the detonator fires the priming charge,
and so explodes the torpedo. The foremost extremity of the torpedo,
which is termed the nose piece, is so fitted that it is capable of being
forced inwards, but in a position of rest its inner edge is just clear of
the catch. On a pressure being brought on the nose piece in a direct
line with the length of the torpedo, it will be forced inwards, the result
being the releasing of the catch and explosion of the torpedo. In
addition to the nose piece, horizontal and vertical levers, or whiskers,
may also be used, a slight pressure on either of which will similarly
effect the explosion of the torpedo; also cutters for penetrating nets,
&amp;c., are fitted to the nose piece when desired.</p>

<p><i>Safety Wedge and Key.</i>&mdash;For safety purposes a wedge is employed,
which when in the safety position prevents the catch from acting;
this wedge is so arranged that it may be withdrawn by the action of
the machinery after the torpedo has run a certain distance, and also
may be replaced by similar means in the safety position on the completion
of the run. As an additional precaution a safety key is used,
which is inserted in the head of the torpedo through the spring of
the frame.</p>

<p><i>Description of Adjustment Apparatus.</i>&mdash;For adjusting the length of
range for withdrawing and replacing the safety wedge, &amp;c., the
following apparatus is employed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Two cog wheels, a large and a small one, are fixed on the upper part
of the after end of the torpedo, just in front of the screw propellers:
the small wheel is fitted with a certain number of teeth, thirty for
instance, which gears into an endless screw attached to the propeller in
such a manner that one revolution of the propeller moves the wheel
one tooth, therefore thirty revolutions would turn the wheel one
complete revolution. The big wheel is fitted with much larger teeth
than the small one, and by means of a pin on the latter wheel is moved
round one tooth for every complete revolution of the small wheel, and
clamped in this new position by a spring catch, which is also worked
by the pin on the small wheel. In front of these wheels is a stud
which works fore and aft in a slot, and attached to a spring which
tends to draw it to the after end of the slot. This stud is connected
by means of a wire rod to the valve that admits the compressed air to
the engines; when the stud is in the fore part of the slot the valve is
open, and when in the after part it is closed.</p>

<p><i>Adjusting Length of Range.</i>&mdash;By means of a lever the spring of the
stud is compressed, and the stud moved to the fore part of the slot;
then the big wheel is moved round until a stud on its face is the
required number of teeth above the lever. For every thirty revolutions
of the propeller, and consequently one tooth of the big wheel, a certain
known distance is traversed, which varies according to the pattern of
the torpedo.</p>

<p><i>Adjusting Apparatus.</i>&mdash;When the propeller has made the number of
revolutions corresponding to the length of range required, and consequently
has moved the big wheel the number of teeth it was set
above the lever, the stud on the big wheel presses against the lever and
so releases the spring in the slot, causing the slot stud to fly from the
fore part to the after part of the slot, by which action the valve admitting
the compressed air to the engines is closed, and consequently the
engines cease to work.</p>

<p>Attached to the axle of the big wheel is a small brass arm, which is
connected by means of a brass rod to the safety wedge, and is so arranged
that after the required number of revolutions of the propeller, the safety
wedge will be drawn out; or it may be drawn out at the instant of the
torpedo leaving the tube, carriage, &amp;c. Also by means of an additional
lever at the fore part of the torpedo, which is connected by means of a
wire rod to the valve that admits the air to the engines, and by arranging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the attachment of the safety wedge to the brass rod from the big
wheel, so that on the wedge being withdrawn it is released from that
brass rod, on the torpedo having completed its run, the action of closing
the valve which admits the air to the engines causes the additional
lever to force the wedge into the safety position.</p>

<p><i>Torpedo to Float at End of Run.</i>&mdash;This is due to the difference of
buoyancy at the end of a run from what it was at the commencement,
owing to the compressed air being used in working the engines.</p>

<p><i>Torpedo to Sink at End of Run.</i>&mdash;This is effected by means of the
adjustment chamber (2), in the after end of which there is a spiral
spring valve, which can be attached to the brass rod on the outside
of the torpedo that works the valve which admits air to the engines, in
such a way that on the valve being closed, and therefore the run of the
torpedo completed, the spiral spring valve is opened, admitting water to
the adjustment chamber (2) of sufficient amount to sink the torpedo.</p>

<p><i>To Explode the Torpedo at End of Run.</i>&mdash;This is effected by connecting
the vertical firing whisker to the rod which otherwise would be
connected to the safety wedge lever, by which means, on the valve
admitting air to the engines being closed, a force is transmitted to the
vertical whisker instead of to the safety wedge lever, and consequently
the torpedo is exploded.</p>

<p><i>Adjusting the Depth.</i>&mdash;A small wheel, the face of which is marked in
feet, is placed on the left side of the fore part of the adjustment
chamber (2). To adjust for depth, by means of a key turn the wheel
until the number corresponding to the depth of run required is
opposite the pointer.</p>

<p>The torpedo is maintained at the desired depth by means of certain
mechanical apparatus contained within the adjustment chamber (2),
and which constitutes what is termed the secret of the fish torpedo.
This chamber is connected by screws to the foremost and after
chambers of the torpedo, in such a manner that by means of a number
of small holes bored round the circumference, as shown at (2), <a href="#Fig_119">Fig. 119</a>,
the faces of the chamber are exposed to the pressure of the water,
which varies with the depth to which the torpedo descends. Within
the adjustment chamber is an endless strong spiral spring, attached to
the after face of the chamber, and so arranged that after being set to
a certain tension, capable of resisting an equivalent pressure on the
outside of the aforesaid face, any increase or decrease in this exterior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
pressure will cause the spiral spring to work a rod by which the
horizontal rudders of the torpedo are regulated, and thus the desired
depth for which the spring is set is maintained. The course of the
torpedo is represented by a series of curves, above and below the line,
representing the depth it is set for, these curves gradually decreasing
until at 100 yards' distance from where the torpedo was started the
curves are so small that the path of the torpedo is almost identical to
that of a straight line.</p>

<p>Within this adjustment chamber is also placed an automatic
balance, which also assists to maintain the torpedo at the desired
depth, by reason of its swinging forward on the torpedo descending,
and swinging aft on its rising, which motion is used to regulate the
horizontal rudders. The above is merely a general idea of the arrangement
used in the Whitehead fish torpedo, to enable it to reach and
maintain whatever depth it may be necessary to use it at from 5
to 15 feet.</p>

<p><i>Projecting the Torpedo.</i>&mdash;The fish torpedo may be projected in
various ways, viz.:&mdash;</p>


<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;Through a submerged tube in the stem, or on the broadside.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;From a carriage above the surface.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;From the surface.</div>

<p><i>Discharging Torpedo through a Submerged Tube in the Stem.</i>&mdash;In this
case a tube is fitted to an orifice in the stem; this opening is as far
below the water line as possible, and is closed by a watertight cap and
a sluice valve; the inner end of the tube is fitted with a watertight
door; the torpedo being prepared for action is placed inside the tube,
the inner door closed, and the tube filled with water; then the watertight
cap and sluice valve are opened, and the torpedo started by
means of a piston which is worked by compressed air. This piston
can be worked from deck, and so the torpedo fired at the proper
instant. To prevent the torpedo from slipping out of the tube, a stop
is placed in the fore end of it, which can be withdrawn at the same
time as the compressed air is admitted behind the piston. The torpedo
being clear of the tube, the sluice valve and watertight cap are closed,
and the tube emptied of the water, the projecting piston being at the
same time forced back.</p>

<p><i>On the Broadside.</i>&mdash;In this case, the discharging tube works inside
an iron casing, through a stuffing box at the inner end, and in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
shield attached to the outer end of the tube. This shield, placed on
the fore side of the orifice, is of such a length as to protect the
torpedo from the pressure of the water passing the vessel. The mode
of discharging the torpedo in this case is similar to that used when
projecting it through the stem.</p>

<p><i>Comparison of the Stem and Broadside Methods of Projecting the
Torpedo.</i>&mdash;The former method of projecting the torpedo seems the
most suitable to specially built torpedo vessels, but not so to large
ironclads, on account of the difficulty of fitting a tube to the stem of
such a ship, and also that in so doing the efficiency of the vessel as a
ram would be impaired.</p>

<p>In regard to the accuracy of the firing of the above methods, both
seem equally good, though in the case of firing on the broadside it
would be necessary to prepare carefully calculated tables of deflection,
any mistake in the using of which would be fatal to a successful
torpedo shot.</p>

<p><i>Projecting a Torpedo from above Water.</i>&mdash;In this case an iron
carriage is used, which is fitted with a frame, in which the torpedo
rests; the outer end of this frame is provided with a lip, some few
feet long, by which means the rear end of the torpedo is slightly
canted up on leaving the frame, and any undue strain on the tail of
the torpedo is prevented. The frame is mounted in the iron carriage
in such a way that it can be elevated or depressed by means of a
screw, as in the case of a gun mounted in an ordinary carriage. The
torpedo is ejected from the frame by means of a piston as previously
explained, a small reservoir of air being attached to the carriage, so
that it can be used at any port.</p>

<p><i>Firing a Torpedo from the Surface.</i>&mdash;The torpedo possesses sufficient
buoyancy to float with a small portion of its upper surface above water;
such being the case, it is only necessary to set the various adjustments,
point it in the required direction, and by hand turn back the lever on
the upper part of the weapon (which opens a communication between
the air chamber and the engines), when it will instantly dart off and
very rapidly attain the depth it is set for.</p>

<p><i>Method of Firing a Fish Torpedo from a Boat.</i>&mdash;To manipulate a fish
torpedo from a boat, it may be carried in a light frame, which can be
lowered or raised by means of a pair of davits. When required to
discharge the torpedo, the frame containing it is lowered into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
water, so as to bring the torpedo about two feet below the surface, the
head being somewhat lower than the tail.</p>

<p><i>Thornycroft's Method of Firing Fish Torpedoes from a Boat.</i>&mdash;Another
method, which has been patented by Mr. J. I. Thornycroft, of the firm
of J. I. Thornycroft and Co., steam launch builders, and which is fitted
to the torpedo boats built by them for foreign governments, is shown
in elevation and plan at <a href="#Fig_120">Fig. 120</a> and <a href="#Fig_121">121</a>.</p>

<p>The apparatus consists of two or more bent levers <i>A</i> securely and
rigidly fixed on a shaft <i>B</i>, which works in bearings fixed on the deck
of the vessel <i>C</i> from which the torpedo is to be discharged. On the
ends of the levers <i>A</i> furthest from the shaft <i>B</i> are pivoted other levers
<i>D</i>, to which the cradle or case <i>E</i> for sustaining the torpedo is suspended.
The other ends of each of these levers are connected to the
vessel by means of rods or tubes <i>F</i>, jointed at each end in such a way
that when the shaft <i>B</i> is made to revolve in its bearings, the case containing
the torpedo is guided over the side of the vessel and close to
it, and is held in a position convenient for discharging the torpedo, as
shown at <a href="#Fig_120">Fig. 120</a>.</p>

<p>The shaft <i>B</i> may be made to revolve by means of ropes <i>G</i> and
pulleys <i>H</i> attached to the levers <i>A</i>, or by hydraulic or steam pressure,
as may be found most convenient.</p>

<p>The torpedo case can be towed alongside the vessel if necessary
without deranging the apparatus. The torpedo case is carried in the
angles of the bent levers, and is stowed away so that neither it nor the
suspending levers project at all beyond the hull of the vessel; also
when lowered, the levers and suspending rods fold over one another so
as to occupy very little space, and the torpedo is suspended close to
the hull.</p>

<p>Also the torpedo during the operation of lowering as well as when
in a firing position remains close to the side of the vessel, thereby
obviating any risk or inconvenience from excessive leverage which
would have a tendency to capsize the boat.</p>

<p>For especially built torpedo launches, the above mode of carrying
and launching the fish torpedo is certainly the best yet devised.</p>

<p><i>Woolwich Fish Torpedo.</i>&mdash;In the Woolwich torpedo, the engines
exert a force of nearly 60 indicated horses, and work up to 1000
revolutions per minute; the total weight of the torpedo fully charged
(33 lbs. of gun-cotton) is about 500 lbs.</p>

<p><i>The Lay Torpedo Boat.</i>&mdash;Priority of invention of this torpedo was
on the 13th of June, 1873, awarded by the Commissioners of Patents
to Mr. John Louis Lay, several other persons having claimed the
invention, among whom was Colonel Von Scheliha, an officer of the
Russian army.</p>

<p>This locomotive torpedo, or more properly called torpedo boat, has
been for several years adopted by the American government, during
which time it has undergone a series of exhaustive experiments, which
has proved it to be a most valuable and efficient weapon of offence
and defence. Lately the Russian government have adopted it, and
intend using it extensively in the defence of their harbours, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>General Description of the Torpedo.</i>&mdash;At <a href="#Fig_122">Fig. 122</a> is shown a longitudinal
section of a Lay torpedo boat constructed and provided with
guiding and controlling apparatus, and with means for propelling it
by ammoniacal gas. <a href="#Fig_123">Fig. 123</a> is a horizontal section of the same; <i>A</i>
is the hull or body of the boat, which has conical ends <i>A</i><sup>1</sup>, <i>A</i><sup>2</sup>, and is
formed of thin plate iron, or steel, or other suitable material. The
section in the end <i>A</i><sup>1</sup> forms the magazine containing the charge of
dynamite or other explosive material; <i>A</i><sup>3</sup> is the section containing the
gas reservoir or holder; the compartment <i>A</i><sup>4</sup> contains the apparatus
for holding and paying out the electric cable; the compartment <i>A</i><sup>5</sup>
in the end <i>A</i><sup>2</sup> contains the motor engine, the steering apparatus, and
other parts to be hereinafter described. All of these compartments or
sections are separated from each other by means of air-tight bulkheads
<i>A</i><sup>6</sup>. The torpedo boat may be propelled by means of a single screw,
double screw, or two screws. In the latter method, which is shown at
<a href="#Fig_122">Fig. 122</a> and <a href="#Fig_123">123</a>, the propellers <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> are made to revolve in
opposite directions; the shaft <i>D</i> of the propeller <i>B</i> is hollow or
tubular, and the shaft <i>E</i> of the screw <i>C</i> passes through the same; these
screws are actuated by an engine shown at <i>F.</i> <i>H</i>, <i>H</i> are the horizontal
rudders, or side wings, two forward and two aft; these wings are
mounted on shafts or spindles passing transversely through the boat;
these rudders may be set to occupy a horizontal position, or a more or
less inclined position in the proper direction, to cause the submerging
of the boat by the action of the water on the said rudders as the boat
moves forward, and they are adjusted before starting. <i>N</i>, <i>N</i> are two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
guide rods, one aft and one forward, which project up from the boat to
enable the operator to determine its position at any part of its run, and
in the case of a night attack they are provided with lights; the said
rods can be raised or lowered at the will of the operator. <i>Q</i> is the
electric cable, which affords a medium of communication between the
operator on shore, &amp;c., and the torpedo boat, whereby it may be started,
stopped, steered, fired, and has her position ascertained; this cable is
carried in the boat in a coil arranged longitudinally in the air-tight
chamber <i>A</i><sup>4</sup> in the reel frame <i>R</i>, and is payed out as the torpedo
progresses through a tube <i>S</i>, projecting aft under the boat and beyond
the rudders and propellers, so that the said cable will not be fouled by
the same; or it may be payed out through a hollow shaft in the centre
of the boat. One end of this cable is connected to a keyboard at the
station on shore or on board of the ship or other structure from which
the torpedo boats are controlled. This keyboard is provided with a
suitable battery or other means for generating the electric current,
as hereinafter described.</p>

<p>The said cable is composed of several wires, each of which is
insulated from the others. One of these wires is connected with the
mechanism for starting and stopping the boat, one is connected with
the steering apparatus, one serves for indicating to the operator at all
times the exact position of the rudder, one is connected with mechanism
for elevating and depressing the said guide rods, and one serves for
firing the charge in the magazine.</p>

<p>The motive power for effecting the necessary movements of the
mechanism or apparatus in performing the above operations is obtained
from the aforesaid engines, which are provided with suitable valves
arranged in combination with electro magnets, shunts, and the devices
connected with the said wires of the cable, as hereinafter set forth.</p>

<p>This form of cable has since been replaced by one which consists of
two wires only, the one for performing all of the necessary operations,
exclusive of the firing or exploding of the magazine, and the other
exclusively for this latter purpose. This improvement is effected by
employing a series of relays or resistance coils, or a multiple, or
compound relay in the boat. The advantages gained by this improved
form of cable are:&mdash;</p>


<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;Increased flexibility.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;A greater length of cable may be coiled in a given space.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;A thicker coat of insulating material may be used, thereby
more perfectly insulating it.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;It is much cheaper.</div>

<p>Two rudders are generally used, one below and one above the boat,
as shown at <i>U</i>, <a href="#Fig_122">Fig. 122</a>. These rudders are operated and controlled
by means of a small auxiliary engine <i>T</i>, <a href="#Fig_122">Fig. 122</a>, which is started,
stopped, and reversed by the electric current conducted through the
cable <i>Q</i> in connection with magnets attached directly to a valve
forming part of the said engine. This valve is so actuated by the
magnets that when the current passes in one direction the engine <i>T</i>
will move the rudder to starboard, and when the current acts in the
opposite direction it will turn the rudder to port.</p>

<p>The mechanism for firing the charge in the magazine <i>A</i><sup>1</sup> is clearly
shown in <a href="#Fig_124">Fig. 124</a>, and operates as follows:&mdash;Projecting from the
front extremity or stem of the boat is a rod or pin <i>V</i>, which extends
through a suitable packing box <i>W</i> into the said magazine or charge
chamber; when the boat strikes an object, the said rod is forced
inward into contact with the springs or points <i>X</i>, thereby closing an
electrical circuit and igniting a cartridge, shown at <i>Y</i>, in the magazine.</p>

<p>The charge in the magazine can also be fired at any moment by
the operator on shore closing a circuit on the keyboard and thereby
cutting out one of two resistance coils placed in the circuit to prevent
accidental or premature discharge&mdash;that is to say, there are two
resistance coils. The battery is not sufficiently powerful to fire
through both resistance coils at the same time. When the boat
strikes an object, the resistance coil in the magazine is cut out by the
driving inward of the rod <i>V</i>, as above described; the battery then
fires through the one on the keyboard. On the other hand, if the
operator desires to fire the torpedo boat before she touches the object
of attack, he manipulates the switch to cut out the coil in the keyboard,
the charge then being fired through the coil in the magazine.
This arrangement of the two resistance coils is very effectual in
preventing accidents.</p>

<p>In some instances the magazine is made detachable from the hull
of the boat, so that on striking an object it will descend or drop down
in the water before exploding. This modification is shown at <a href="#Fig_125">Fig.
125</a> and <a href="#Fig_126">126</a>.</p>

<p>The magazine <i>A</i>* is attached at its lower side to the boat by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
chain or other suitable connection. At its upper edge it is held by
a rod <i>a</i>*, as shown in <a href="#Fig_125">Fig. 125</a>. This rod is fitted to slide in dovetailed
bearings, as shown at <i>b</i>*, and when this magazine is in its place on the
boat the said rod is engaged with a catch or stop <i>c</i>*, but when the said
rod is driven against any object it is forced back and released from
the said catch or stop, and the magazine then drops, as in <a href="#Fig_126">Fig. 126</a>,
and is fired.</p>

<p>To effect the firing a ball <i>d</i>* is used and placed in a tube containing
two springs or plates <i>e</i>* and arranged in an upwardly inclined
position, as shown in <a href="#Fig_125">Fig. 125</a>, one of the said springs being connected
with the cable and the other with a wire that passes through the
cartridge to earth.</p>

<p>While the magazine is in the position shown in <a href="#Fig_125">Fig. 125</a> the
circuit is incomplete, but when the magazine drops the said ball falls
into the position shown in Fig. 126; the circuit is then completed,
and the magazine is fired.</p>

<p>The electrical or electro-magnetic apparatus for generating,
directing, and controlling the currents, whereby the above-described
operations are effected, may be of any suitable kind, the following
being the form of apparatus usually employed.</p>

<p>A battery <i>r</i>, shown at <a href="#Fig_127">Fig. 127</a>, consists of any desired or requisite
number of cells constructed and arranged in any suitable manner, and
connected by proper conducting wires with the keyboard <i>s</i>. The
latter is provided with a series of pole changers <i>s</i><sup>1</sup>, <i>s</i><sup>2</sup>, <i>s</i><sup>3</sup>, <i>s</i><sup>4</sup>, and
switches <i>s</i><sup>5</sup>, <i>s</i><sup>6</sup>, and is shown in <a href="#Fig_128">Fig. 128</a>.</p>

<p>Each of these pole changers is arranged to effect and control one
of the above-named operations, and is therefore connected with one
of the aforesaid insulated wires forming the cable. For instance, the
pole changer <i>s</i><sup>1</sup> effects the starting and stopping of the propelling
engine; <i>s</i><sup>2</sup> controls the steering apparatus; <i>s</i><sup>3</sup> is connected with the
steering index; <i>s</i><sup>4</sup> operates or adjusts the aforesaid guiding rods; and
the switches <i>s</i><sup>5</sup>, <i>s</i><sup>6</sup> control and effect the firing of the charge in the
magazine.</p>

</div>

<p>The connections between these pole changers and switches, and
the apparatus they operate or control on board the boat, are as follows&mdash;that
is to say, the said propelling engines have a throttle valve,
which controls the admission of the gas from its generator or reservoir
to the cylinders of the said engine, and in combination with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
valve in the boat there is a shunt and set of electro magnets. The
armature of the latter is connected with a lever, which is pivoted so
that the action of the electric current in one direction through these
magnets will pull one end of the said lever down, and the action of
the current in the other direction will pull its other end down&mdash;that
is to say, by reversing the current through these magnets the movement
of the said lever is reversed; and this lever, connected by
suitable means with the slide of the said throttle valve, will open or
close the same, and thereby start or stop the engine as required.</p>

<p>For operating and controlling the above-described steering
apparatus, and indicating the position of the rudder to the operator
on shore, the following devices are employed, in combination with the
pole changers <i>s</i><sup>2</sup>, <i>s</i><sup>3</sup> on the keyboard:&mdash;The pole changers are geared
together by insulated toothed wheels, which are fixed on the spindles
or axes of the said pole changers, so that the latter work accurately
together and maintain the same relative positions to each other. The
pole changer <i>s</i><sup>2</sup> is connected by one of the said insulated cable wires
with a shunt on board the boat, which shunt is connected with a set of
magnets arranged in combination with the valve of the engine that
drives the steering apparatus, and which valve is reversed or opened
and closed by the reversal of the currents through the said magnets,
as above described, and the said engine moves the rudder to port or
starboard at the will of the operator. In order that the operator may
know the exact position of the rudder at any moment, a series of pins
or projections fixed on an arc or other portion of the rudder stock,
and arranged in combination with an insulated spring projecting into
the path of the said series of pins, are employed. This spring is connected
by one of the cable wires with the pole changer <i>s</i><sup>3</sup> on the keyboard,
which is geared with and moves in unison with the pole
changer <i>s</i><sup>2</sup>, so that the electric current that controls the steering
engine, and the current that returns the indication of the rudder's
position, will both be reversed simultaneously. A separate battery
is connected with the index on the said keyboard, whereby a constant
current is maintained between this index and the indicating apparatus
on the boat.</p>

<p>The current passing from the said spring to the shore is made to
indicate the position of the rudder by the index on the keyboard by
the contrivance shown in <a href="#Fig_129">Fig. 129</a>. This contrivance consists of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
set of magnets <i>w</i>, which have a vibrating armature <i>w</i><sup>1</sup> pivoted to
oscillate between them. One end of the armature lever is provided
with insulated spring pawls <i>w</i><sup>2</sup>, which take into ratchet wheels <i>w</i><sup>3</sup>.
On the same shafts on which these ratchet wheels are fixed are wheels
<i>w</i>* formed with insulated teeth and geared with each other. The shaft
of one of these wheels is geared by bevel pinions <i>w</i><sup>4</sup> with a vertical
shaft <i>w</i><sup>5</sup>, to which is attached the index needle or finger <i>x</i>**, <a href="#Fig_128">Fig. 128</a>.
Therefore it will be obvious that this index finger is placed in connection
with the aforesaid spring and series of pins attached to the
rudder yoke on board the boat.</p>

<p>Now it will be obvious that when the rudder is turned in either
direction these pins will come successively in contact with the said
spring, and at each contact and separation the circuit will be made
and broken, and an impulse will be transmitted through the cable,
whereby a corresponding movement will be transmitted to the said
index finger or pointer <i>x</i>** on the keyboard.</p>

<p>The pole changer <i>s</i><sup>4</sup> is connected with another of the insulated
wires of the cable, which on board the boat is connected with a shunt
and set of magnets arranged in combination with the aforesaid
cylinders that operate the said guiding rods, so that by sending the
current in one direction the said rods will be raised, and by sending
the current in the opposite direction the said rods will be lowered.</p>

<p>The switch <i>s</i><sup>5</sup> is connected with another of the said insulated
wires of the cable, which forms the circuit, including the aforesaid
two resistance coils.</p>

<p>By adjusting this switch the operator completes the circuit through
the two resistance coils, and then, but not till then, the charge can
be exploded, either by the operator, or by the action of the firing pin
or rod when the same is driven in and cuts out the other resistance
coils as above described. The resistance coil <i>X</i><sup>1</sup>, <a href="#Fig_124">Fig. 124</a>, is connected
to the binding screws 9, 10 by the wires 7 and 8. These
binding screws are in metallic connection with the two springs <i>X</i>, but
otherwise they are carefully insulated. One pole of the fuze <i>Y</i> is
connected to the binding screw 10, the other put to earth through the
body of the boat, as at <i>E</i>; the main wire 11 is connected to the
binding screw 9. Now when the operator cuts out the resistance coil
at the firing station, which is done by moving the switch <i>s</i><sup>6</sup>, the
electric current is sufficiently powerful to ignite the fuze <i>Y</i> through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the resistance coil <i>X</i><sup>1</sup>, so that at any moment the torpedo may be
exploded by the operator on shore, or by the contact between the
torpedo and the attacked vessel the rod <i>V</i> will be driven in, and,
coming in contact with the springs <i>X</i>, will bridge over the space that
originally existed between them and so cut out the resistance coil <i>X</i><sup>1</sup>,
and the torpedo will be exploded automatically.</p>

<p><i>Capabilities of the Lay Torpedo Boat.</i>&mdash;The capabilities of the Lay
torpedo boat are as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;It may be launched from the shore, a vessel, or a structure,
and be kept under observation, and accurately guided or
directed to the ship or other object to be attacked; and
it may be exploded at any desired moment, or it may be
caused to return to the original point of departure without
being fired.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;It may be totally and instantaneously submerged to prevent
its destruction or capture by the enemy, and it may be
raised to the surface, as soon as the danger has passed, in
a condition fit for immediate action.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;It may be used as a tug or towing boat to take out a number
of torpedoes, which may be sunk and exploded when
desired.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;It may be used in connection with certain apparatus to clear
away obstructions found to prevent the entrance of ships
into harbours, and it may also be used to clear harbours
of mines, &amp;c.</div>

<p><i>Launching the Lay Torpedo Boat.</i>&mdash;For facilitating the launching
and controlling of the Lay torpedo boats, a structure or submarine fort
is used. This structure may be square, or oblong, and may be made
to carry any number of the torpedo boats. The body is constructed of
plate or sheet iron of suitable strength and stiffened with angle iron,
or otherwise, and divided longitudinally or transversely into watertight
compartments, into which the water is admitted to sink the said
structure. At the top or upper side, cylinders or tubes are placed,
each of which is capable of containing and launching one of the
torpedo boats. At the forward end of each tube is a door, or cover
secured to a rod or shaft fitted to turn in suitable bearings; this rod or
shaft is provided with an arm which is connected to the piston rod of
an engine worked by gas contained in a reservoir, or by other suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
means. The slide or other valve which controls the admission of the
gas, &amp;c., to this engine is arranged in connection with electro magnets,
connected by a suitable cable with a keyboard on shore, or wherever
the operator's station may be. By sending an electric current through
this cable in one direction through the electro magnets, the door is
closed; and by sending such a current in the opposite direction it is
opened. The cables carried in the torpedo boats, and through which
the mechanism on board each torpedo boat is operated and controlled,
are also in this case connected with the keyboard, which must be
provided with a number of sets of pole changers and switches, or
equivalent devices, corresponding with the number of boats to be
controlled by means of the said keyboard.</p>

<p>This apparatus will form a very convenient adjunct to fortifications
or stations liable to be attacked by sea. The said fort may be prepared
for use by placing torpedo boats in the said tubes, and may be
kept floating until the enemy's ships have arrived closely enough to
permit the determination of the point where the said fort can be most
advantageously located for operating against the said ships. The fort
is then towed to this point, or taken as near as possible thereto on
rails, and towed the remainder of the distance. It is then submerged,
and will be ready for immediate operation. The said fort is provided
with suitable valves for the admission of water to sink the same,
and with means for forcing in air through the pipe <i>P</i>* to expel the
water when the fort is to be raised.</p>

<p>When it is desired to launch either of the said torpedo boats, the
door of its tube or cylinder is first opened by sending a current
through the cable that controls the door, as above described. Then
the current is sent through the boat's cable to start her propelling
engines. The said boat will then emerge from the cylinder or tube
and will rise to the surface, or as near the surface as may be desired,
and may then be directed and controlled by the operator at the keyboard,
as previously described. And one after another of the said
torpedo boats may be thus launched and exploded, without giving to
the enemy any clue to the point or position from which they are
being sent.</p>

<p><i>Launching the Torpedo from a Ship.</i>&mdash;The method of launching the
Lay torpedo boat from an ironclad or other large ship is shown at <a href="#Fig_130">Fig.
130</a>. The tubes or cylinders <i>S</i> in which the torpedo boats <i>A</i> are held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
are, in the apparatus shown at <a href="#Fig_130">Fig. 130</a>, closed at their inner ends by
plates, or covers <i>S</i><sup>1</sup>, which are provided with suitable water-tight and
insulating packing boxes <i>S</i><sup>2</sup> for the passage of the electric cables of
the said torpedo boats, each cable being connected with the keyboard,
which is placed in any convenient part of the ship, and at their outer
ends the said tubes are furnished with strong and well-fitted slide
valves, or sluice gates <i>S</i><sup>3</sup>, which are opened by screws, connected by
gearing with a hand wheel, and shaft <i>S</i><sup>4</sup>, <i>S</i><sup>5</sup>, for the admission and
exit of the said torpedo boats. Also these cylinders are provided with
packing pieces at their sides, arranged to be pressed by screws or
otherwise up to the sides of the torpedo boats in these cylinders, and
thereby hold them firmly and immovably in rough weather.</p>

<p><i>The Method of Sinking and Raising a Lay Torpedo Boat.</i>&mdash;The
apparatus by which this is effected is shown at <a href="#Fig_131">Fig. 131</a>, which is a
longitudinal section of a portion of a torpedo boat. The hull <i>A</i> of the
torpedo boat is provided with a water chamber <i>l</i>, which has holes or
apertures <i>l</i><sup>1</sup> in the bottom of the same, and is also provided with an air
cock at <i>l</i><sup>2</sup>. In connection with this chamber is arranged a small cylinder
<i>m</i>, provided with a piston <i>m</i><sup>1</sup>, whose rod <i>m</i><sup>2</sup> is attached to the lever of
the said cock. A spiral spring <i>m</i><sup>3</sup> is provided to resist the inward
movement of the said piston. The said small cylinder <i>m</i> is connected
by a pipe <i>m</i><sup>4</sup> with a valve chest, in which is arranged a slide valve <i>m</i><sup>5</sup>.
The said slide valve is connected by a rod or rods to the lever or
levers <i>m</i><sup>6</sup>, whose fulcrum is at <i>m</i>*, and the said levers are connected by
the links or rods <i>m</i><sup>7</sup> with the armatures of electro magnets <i>n</i>, which
are included in the circuit of the cable, whereby the boat is controlled
from the keyboard at the station; <i>o</i> is a pipe extending from the said
valve chest to the aforesaid water chamber <i>l</i>; <i>p</i> is a feed pipe by which
gas is conducted from the reservoir or generator to the valve chamber.</p>

<p>When it is desired to sink the torpedo boat an electric current is
sent in one direction through the said magnets, and thereby operates
the slide valve to admit gas to the cylinder <i>m</i> in front of the piston <i>m</i><sup>1</sup>,
which is thus forced inward and opens the air cock <i>l</i><sup>2</sup>. The opening of
this cock permits the escape of the air from the water chamber <i>l</i>, and
consequently the entrance of water through the apertures <i>l</i><sup>1</sup>, and the
boat then immediately sinks.</p>

<p>When it is desired to raise the boat a current is sent in the opposite
direction through the said electro magnets, thereby operating the said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
valve and piston in such a manner as to close the cock <i>l</i><sup>2</sup> and open the
port <i>o</i><sup>1</sup> and the pipe <i>o</i>, thereby allowing the gas to pass from the valve
chamber into the compartment <i>l</i>; this gas by its pressure expels the
water from the said compartment, and the boat then having its normal
buoyancy restored immediately rises to the surface.</p>

<p><i>The Lay Torpedo Boat used as a Tug to take out a Number of Small
Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;This arrangement is shown at <a href="#Fig_132">Fig. 132</a> and <a href="#Fig_133">133</a>. The
small vessels or torpedoes are designed to be first sunk and then
exploded, chiefly for clearing harbour or the like of mines or other
obstructions. These results are accomplished by means of the following
devices and arrangements, that is to say, each of the small vessels or
torpedoes <i>F</i> is provided with apparatus which is included in an
electrical circuit formed by a suitable insulated cable <i>G</i>, extending
throughout the train of small vessels or torpedoes <i>F</i>. One vessel of
this train, preferably the rear one, is connected with the station by an
electrical cable <i>H</i>, which is payed out from a coil or coils, or a reel or
reels, in the said vessel as the same travels through the water. This
cable <i>H</i> connects with the cable <i>G</i>, which is connected with the towing
boat <i>A</i>, and passes through the series of boats <i>F</i> to the said cable <i>H</i>.
One wire of the said cable is arranged in combination with sealed or
covered apertures in the bottom of a compartment or compartments
of these small vessels <i>F</i>, as shown at <i>I</i>, the covers of these apertures
being so formed as to be ruptured or destroyed by the explosion of a
cartridge or cartridges placed in the said compartment or compartments.
When a current of electricity is sent through the aforesaid
wire of the cable it will explode the said cartridges and open the
apertures, thereby admitting water into the said compartments so that
the vessel <i>F</i> will sink.</p>

<p>The cable <i>G</i> that passes through the train of torpedoes or vessels
<i>F</i> is so arranged that when a current passes through the other wire of
the said cable it will fire cartridges placed in the charge chambers or
magazines of the said small vessels, as shown at <i>J</i>. The part of the
cable or towing line <i>G</i>, which connects the towing boat <i>A</i> with the
train of small boats or torpedoes <i>F</i>, is attached to a hook or other
device, which can be disengaged by sending a current through the
cable <i>K</i>, connecting the boat <i>A</i> with the shore or other station. It
will be understood that when being used for this purpose the said boat
<i>A</i> is not or need not be charged with explosive material.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_135"></a><a id="Fig_134"></a><a id="Fig_133"></a><a id="Fig_132"></a>
<div class="caption"><a href="images/i_246-big.jpg">LAY'S LOCOMOTIVE TORPEDO.</a></div>
<img src="images/i_246.jpg" width="600" height="376" alt="Plate XLI" /><a id="Plate_XLI"></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>The aforesaid towing boat <i>A</i> takes the train of torpedoes <i>F</i> to any
required position. It is then disengaged from the train, leaving the
said small vessels or torpedoes <i>F</i> floating in such position. Then by
sending a current first through one wire of the cable <i>H</i> the boats <i>F</i>
are first sunk by the explosion of the cartridges and opening of the
apertures, as above described. They may then be discharged immediately
by sending a current through the other wire of said cable <i>H</i>
and firing the cartridges in their magazines, or they may be left
submerged to form mines which may be exploded at any desired
moment.</p>

<p>The said small vessels or torpedoes may be provided with vertical
rods to indicate their position to the operator at the station; these rods
are shown at <i>L</i>, and they should be made hollow to allow the air in the
water compartments or chambers to escape to permit the water to enter
the same when the vessels <i>F</i> are to be sunk; or other suitable provision
may be made for the escape of the air from these compartments.</p>

<p>The said vessels <i>F</i> are preferably made cylindrical with conical ends,
and are provided with suitable insulating and water-tight packing
boxes, as shown at <i>F</i><sup>1</sup> for the cable <i>G</i> to pass through at the stem and
stern of each vessel.</p>

<p><i>The Lay Torpedo in Clearing Obstructions.</i>&mdash;For this purpose the
torpedo boat is provided with an apparatus, shown at <a href="#Fig_134">Fig. 134</a> and <a href="#Fig_135">135</a>,
in combination with the electric cable, whereby the said boat is controlled
and guided, and there is arranged in the boat <i>A</i> a compartment
<i>A</i><sup>3</sup>, from which extends down into the water a line or rod <i>U</i>, provided
at its outer end with a hook or claw <i>U</i><sup>1</sup>, properly formed to take hold
of any chain or bar with which it may come in contact. In the said
compartment <i>A</i><sup>3</sup>, and upon the upper end of the said line or rod <i>U</i>, is
placed a small case or cylinder <i>U</i><sup>2</sup> containing a charge of dynamite
or other explosive material and a cartridge or fulminating cap, or
a bottle of sulphuric acid, surrounded with a certain quantity of
chlorate of potash and sugar. This case or cylinder <i>U</i><sup>2</sup> is shown
detached and drawn to an enlarged scale at <a href="#Fig_135">Fig. 135</a>, and it will be
seen that the said case is provided with a tube 1 containing a cartridge,
or a phial filled with explosive substance at 2, and a ball or weight at
3. The said case is fitted to slide upon the said line or rod <i>U</i>, and
when placed at the upper end thereof and not held or retained will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>slide to the lower end of the same. In the said compartment <i>A</i><sup>3</sup> is
arranged at <i>U</i><sup>4</sup> an electro-magnetic apparatus, included in the circuit
of the said cable, and connected with a bolt or catch which in its normal
position holds the said explosive case and prevents its running down
on the grappling line or rod <i>U</i>. This explosive case is also provided
at its lower end with a grappling hook <i>U</i><sup>5</sup>.</p>

<p>When the grappling hook <i>U</i><sup>1</sup>, on the lower or outer end of the line
or rod <i>U</i>, engages with any obstruction the boat will be stopped, and
this stoppage will be indicated on the keyboard. The operator by this
indication is apprised of the stoppage of the boat by an obstruction,
and by sending a current through the cable by means of a switch provided
for this purpose on the keyboard he can immediately release the
explosive case <i>U</i><sup>2</sup>, which runs down the line or rod <i>U</i>, and engages by
its grappling hook <i>U</i><sup>5</sup> with the hook <i>U</i><sup>1</sup>. The line or rod <i>U</i> is then
disengaged from the boat <i>A</i>, and the explosive case <i>U</i><sup>2</sup> turns or falls
over. As it turns over the ball or weight 3 contained in the tube 1
drops on the said phial 2, fractures it, and thereby allows the acid to
mix with the explosive or fulminating charge and explode the case <i>U</i><sup>2</sup>.
This explosion will rupture or destroy the obstructing chain or bar, so
that the ironclad ships or other vessels can pass freely and safely into
the harbour or beyond the point where it was intended to stop them.</p>

<p><i>Used to clear away Mines and Electric Cables.</i>&mdash;For this purpose
there is an implement <i>V</i> provided, <a href="#Fig_136">Fig. 136</a>, somewhat of an anchor
form, but with four or any desired number of arms <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> extending outward
at a suitable angle from its shank <i>V</i><sup>1</sup>. In the neck of each of
these arms are fitted two small plain or toothed discs <i>V</i><sup>3</sup>, which are so
arranged as to present their teeth to any object lying in the angle or
corner formed by and between the arms <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> and shank <i>V</i><sup>1</sup> of the said
implement, as shown at <i>W</i>.</p>

<p>In using this implement it may be attached to a line or cable
coiled in the torpedo boat, which, in this case, is used without being
charged with explosive material, and is sent in advance of any ship
that has to enter or pass through the suspected water. This line must
be arranged in combination with a detaching apparatus controlled by
electro-magnetic apparatus included in the circuit of the cable which
connects the torpedo boat with the keyboard at the operating station.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_137"></a><a id="Fig_136"></a>
<div class="caption"><a href="images/i_250-big.jpg">LAY'S LOCOMOTIVE TORPEDO.</a></div>
<img src="images/i_250.jpg" width="600" height="382" alt="Plate XLII" /><a id="Plate_XLII"></a>
</div>

<p>By sending a current from the station the operator releases the said
implement or its line from the detaching hook or holding device. The
said implement then sinks to the bottom; then the said boat returns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
to the ship, paying out the said line as she so returns. The end of
this line is then taken by a steam tug or other vessel, and the said
grappling implement is thereby dragged along through the water over
which the ships are to advance, thus breaking any wires or cables that
may be in its course. This operation is shown at <a href="#Fig_137">Fig. 137</a>, in which <i>A</i> is
the towing boat, <i>K</i> the controlling cable, <i>V</i> the said implement, <i>V</i>*
the line attached to the implement <i>V</i>, <i>X</i> <i>X</i> submerged mines, and <i>X</i><sup>1</sup>
<i>X</i><sup>1</sup> are the mine cables.</p>

<p>In some instances it may not be practicable to reach the enemy's
ship or other object of attack directly from the station to which the
torpedo boat is connected, and from which it is controlled. In this case
a small boat, &amp;c., is used in addition, which should be so arranged as
to present to the enemy's view as slight a surface as possible. This
mode of attack is shown at <a href="#Fig_138">Fig. 138</a>, where <i>A</i> is the torpedo boat,
and <i>N</i> is the small auxiliary boat. This boat <i>N</i> is provided with a
keyboard and battery like that described at <a href="#Page_144">page 144</a>, and the electric
cable <i>L</i>, carried on and payed out from the torpedo boat <i>A</i>, is connected
with the keyboard. The boat <i>N</i> is also attached to and towed by
the torpedo boat <i>A</i> by the tow line <i>O</i>; and the torpedo boat is steered
and guided by means of the said keyboard in the boat <i>N</i>. The
auxiliary boat is designed to contain two men, who lie down, one at
the bow, the other in any convenient position abaft him; the latter
has control of the keyboard, while the former by the aid of a telescope
keeps the torpedo boat in view, and transmits his orders to the man at
the keyboard. On arriving at such a distance from the enemy as to
render an attack practicable, the tow line <i>O</i> is disengaged, and the
torpedo boat <i>A</i>, guided and controlled, and fired from the boat <i>N</i>. The
torpedo boat being exploded, the auxiliary boat can be rowed back to
the station or ship to which it belongs. By this means the range of
action of the torpedo boat is greatly extended, and with comparatively
slight danger to those employed in making the attack.</p>

<p>A more recent form of the Lay torpedo boat is shown at <a href="#Fig_139">Figs. 139</a>,
<a href="#Fig_140">140</a>, and <a href="#Fig_141">141</a>, where <a href="#Fig_139">Fig. 139</a> is a plan or top view of such a boat,
<a href="#Fig_140">Fig. 140</a> is a side elevation of the same, and <a href="#Fig_141">Fig. 141</a> is a midship
section on the line <i>x x</i>. <i>A</i> is the hull of the boat, <i>a</i> is the main or
central portion of the said hull, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i> are side or auxiliary portions of
the same. These parts <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> may be oval or circular in transverse
section; they are constructed of thin steel or other suitable sheet metal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and secured together by riveting or bolting. The side or auxiliary
portion <i>b</i> form the reservoirs or chambers for the gas; they also serve
to contain the propelling engines. <i>c</i> is the magazine, <i>d</i> the chamber
or compartment for containing the coiled cable, <i>e</i> is the compartment
containing the electrical steering and other apparatus, <i>f</i> is the firing
rod or pin, <i>g</i> is the water ballast chamber, <i>h</i> is the cable, <i>i</i> the paying-out
tube, <i>j</i>, <i>j</i> are the screws or propellers which rotate in opposite
directions, and <i>k</i>, <i>k</i> are the sight or guiding rods.</p>

<p>The parts of the apparatus or mechanism whereby the various
operations of the torpedo boat are effected are connected to the cable
and controlled by electric currents transmitted from the station through
the cable, as previously described. The Lay torpedo boat weighs about
1 ton, its length is 23 feet, and speed 12 knots per hour.</p>

<p><i>Spar or Outrigger Torpedo.</i>&mdash;By a spar or outrigger torpedo is
meant a torpedo which is carried at the end of a pole or spar projecting
from a boat or vessel, and which may be fired either by contact or
at will.</p>

<p>This system of submarine offence has up to the present time been
the only one that has successfully stood the crucial test of actual
warfare.</p>

<p>During the civil war in America the spar torpedo attack was
resorted to by the Confederates and Federals, principally by the
former, the result being the loss of two large men of war and severe
injury to several other ships composing the Federal fleet, and the loss
of one vessel of war belonging to the Southerners.</p>

<p>The spar torpedo was also used on several occasions by the
Russians in their attacks on the Turkish ships in the war of 1877-8,
but in only one attempt was it the means of sinking a Turkish vessel.</p>

<p><i>Description of McEvoy's Duplex Spar Torpedo.</i>&mdash;At <a href="#Fig_142">Fig. 142</a> is shown
a sketch of Captain McEvoy's improved patent duplex spar torpedo,
which is the form most generally used at the present time, and which
seems to fulfil all the requirements of such a submarine weapon, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;Handiness, at the same time capable of containing a charge of
gun-cotton sufficient in contact to destroy the most powerful
vessel afloat.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;Certainty of action.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;Capable of being fired either on contact or at will.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;Mode of attaching the spar simple and very secure.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_141"></a><a id="Fig_140"></a><a id="Fig_139"></a><a id="Fig_138"></a>
<div class="caption"><a href="images/i_254-big.jpg">LAY'S LOCOMOTIVE TORPEDO.</a></div>
<img src="images/i_254.jpg" width="600" height="378" alt="Plate XLIII" /><a id="Plate_XLIII"></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_142">Fig. 142</a>, <i>a</i> is the case, capable of containing some 33 lbs. of
gun-cotton; <i>b</i> is the tube through which the three wires <i>w</i>, <i>w</i><sup>1</sup>, and <i>w</i><sup>2</sup>
are led; <i>c</i> is the socket in which the wooden or steel spar is introduced
and secured, <i>d</i> is the striker, which is attached to a brass
contact plate within the head of the case <i>a</i> in such a manner that
any pressure either on the head or side of the striker <i>d</i> will force
the aforesaid plate in contact with the two studs to which the battery
wires are attached; <i>e</i> is a cradle affixed to the striker <i>d</i> to ensure its
action on contact being made by the torpedo with the attacked vessel;
the explosive is inserted at <i>f</i>, the socket <i>c</i> being made to screw on
and off.</p>

<p>When a hollow steel spar is used, the battery wires are sometimes
led through the interior of the torpedo and the spar, by which means
they are well protected; the only objection to this method of leading
the wires being the probability of injury to them, should the spar be
broken on contact, or by a shot.</p>

<p><i>McEvoy's Arrangement of Torpedo Wires.</i>&mdash;At <a href="#Fig_143">Fig. 143</a> is shown the
arrangement of wires as devised by Captain McEvoy, whereby the spar
torpedo may be exploded at will or on contact. <i>c</i> and <i>z</i> are the poles
of the firing battery, to which are attached respectively the wires <i>d</i> and
<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>; <i>f</i> is the fuze, which is placed in the centre of the charge, and to
the poles of which the wire <i>d</i><sup>2</sup> is attached, the other end of this wire
being connected with the stud <i>s</i>; to the stud <i>s</i><sup>1</sup> is attached the other
end of the wire <i>d</i>, and at the point <i>c</i> in the same wire is inserted a
contact breaker; another wire <i>d</i><sup>1</sup> is connected to the wires <i>d</i> and <i>d</i><sup>2</sup>
at the points <i>r</i> and <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> respectively, and at the point <i>k</i> in this same
wire is inserted a firing key, which latter is shown in section at <a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>,
from which the mode of connecting the two ends of the wires and of
using the key will be at once apparent. The contact breaker is somewhat
similar to the firing key, but there is no spring in it, contact
being made or broken by screwing the two parts together or apart.
The object of the contact breaker is to prevent the torpedo being
exploded by contact, and so to place the control of the weapon entirely
in the hands of the operator. As will be seen from <a href="#Fig_143">Fig. 143</a>, if contact
is broken at <i>c</i>, it is impossible to fire the torpedo unless the firing key
<i>k</i> be pressed in; but should contact be made at <i>c</i>, then either by means
of the firing key <i>k</i>, or by the torpedo striking the hostile vessel,
its ignition will be effected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The foregoing method of arranging the spar torpedo wires is
certainly very neat and effective, and is at the present time in extensive
use. As yet it has not been adopted by the English government, they
still preferring to fire the spar torpedo at will alone.</p>

<p>The different methods of manipulating the spar torpedo from boats
will be described in the following chapter.</p>

<p><i>General Remarks on Offensive Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;The torpedoes that have
been described in this chapter are the only ones that at the present
time can be considered as having been proved to be practically useful,
and which in future wars may be employed against ships with some
chance of success.</p>

<p>The spar, the Whitehead fish, and the Harvey towing torpedo have
each been subjected to the test of actual service, the former weapon
being the only one that has under those conditions been successfully
used. Taking this fact into consideration, also the high pitch of excellence
that has been attained in the construction of steam torpedo boats,
and also the results of the numerous exhaustive experiments that have
been from time to time carried out in England, America, and Europe,
with various modifications of the locomotive, towing, and spar torpedoes,
there can be no two opinions as to which of the numerous species of
offensive submarine weapons is the most practicable and effective, and
that is the spar or outrigger torpedo.</p>

<p>To manipulate successfully locomotive and towing torpedoes in an
attack against hostile vessels, the operators must be not only unusually
fearless and self-possessed, but also must possess a thorough practical
knowledge of the complicated method of working and man&oelig;uvring
those weapons&mdash;in fact, they must be specialists; whilst in the case of
the spar torpedo, which may be fired by contact, it is only necessary to
employ men capable of handling a boat well, and possessed of dash and
pluck, to ensure an attack by such means being generally successful. Of
course under some circumstances, such as in a general action, when
the locomotive and towing torpedoes are manipulated from specially
constructed torpedo vessels, they will prove of great value, and the
fish torpedo fired from a boat, in close proximity to the attacked
vessel, in smooth water, and unmolested, would sink a vessel which
under the same circumstances, owing to her being protected by
booms, might prove impregnable to a spar torpedo attack; but such
favourable conditions will not often occur in war time.</p>

<p>As an offensive submarine weapon of defence, the Lay torpedo boat
should prove of real value; and also man&oelig;uvred from specially constructed
vessels, it seems capable of being used in a variety of ways.
As yet little is known of this weapon, all the experiments carried out
with it having been confined to America; but now that Russia has
adopted it, and one or two have also been secured by the Peruvians, its
practical value will become more generally known.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<small>TORPEDO VESSELS, BOATS, AND SUBMARINE BOATS.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'><i>EMPLOYMENT of Torpedo Ships.</i>&mdash;Torpedo ships, that is to say, sea-going
vessels, very fast, handy and impregnable, specially designed
to carry and operate offensive submarine weapons, such as locomotive,
towing, and the spar torpedoes, especially the former, are now considered
as a necessary and valuable adjunct to a fleet, their special work being
to give the coup de grâce to disabled ironclads in a general action;
they will also be used to attack the ships of a blockading force, and
against rival torpedo vessels. As a general rule these torpedo ships
will be armed with the ram and torpedoes only, heavy guns being
dispensed with, though the Nordenfelt and other machine guns will be
considered necessary.</div>

<p><i>The German Torpedo Vessel Uhlan.</i>&mdash;This torpedo vessel was built
in Germany by the Stettin Engine Company, and launched in 1876.</p>

<p>She is armed with a contact torpedo charged with dynamite carried
on a 10-foot ram, lying deeply under the water line. To protect the
vessel from the effects of the discharge of the torpedo, she is built with
two complete parts, sliding one within the other, and having a considerable
extent of intermediate space between them. This space is
filled with a tough and elastic material (cork and marine glue), which
even in the case of the bows being carried away, would afford a second
line of resistance. The <i>Uhlan</i> carries an engine of one thousand
indicated horse power. The steam is supplied by Belleville's tubular
generator. These engines occupy by far the greater space of the vessel,
only a very small portion being left for her crew and coal. This great
power of the engines is necessitated by the fact that she has to be
driven at a very high speed, at the same time she has a very great
draught, also the greatest facility of steering has to be attained;
hence the proportion of width to length, 25 to 70 feet. In order
to save the crew at the worst, a raft is constructed, which is also filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
with a mixture of cork and marine glue, and is placed near the helm.
The mode of operating with the <i>Uhlan</i> is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The dynamite torpedo is affixed to the point of the ram by the aid
of divers. The rudder is then fixed, and the crew opening a wide
port on the vessel's side, jump on the aforesaid raft. The steamer
then rushes forward, and explodes its torpedo in contact with the
hostile vessel. The crew hold on to the torpedo ship, and in case
she is not injured board her again and repeat the man&oelig;uvre, if
necessary.<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a></p>

<p>This is a novel form of torpedo boat, but does not seem to be a
very practicable method of torpedo attack.</p>

<p><i>Admiral Porter's Torpedo Ship Alarm.</i>&mdash;The <i>Alarm</i> torpedo ship
was built from plans designed by Admiral David D. Porter, U.S.N.
Her total length, which includes a ram 32 feet long, is 172 feet; her
beam is 27 feet 6 inches, and her draught of water is 11 feet. She is
built of iron on the bracket plate system, that is to say, she has a
double hull, one shell being constructed inside the other. Her double
bottom is divided into a number of water-tight compartments. The
whole interior of the vessel is also built in compartments, which may
be hermetically closed, so that in case of both the shells being ruptured,
it would still be impossible to fill the entire ship with water. She is
steered by the same apparatus which propels her, viz. the Fowler
wheel, which is illustrated at <a href="#Fig_145">Fig. 145</a>.</p>

<p>This wheel turns on a vertical shaft, and its paddles are feathered
by an eccentric cam in such a manner that at one part of their revolution
they have a pushing and drawing action on the water, while at
another part they present only their edges. In fact it is simply a
feathering paddle wheel, turned horizontally instead of vertically. By
suitably turning the cam wheel, which is done from the helm, the
feathering of the paddles is caused to occur at different points; and in
this way the vessel may be turned, or rather her stern twisted around,
as if on a pivot. At the same time, by suitably adjusting the paddles,
the ship goes ahead, or astern, the engine meanwhile running in the
same direction.</p>

<p>By the apparatus above described it is considered that the <i>Alarm</i>
is afforded not only a means of speed, but of being handled with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
utmost readiness, which latter is absolutely essential in such a vessel,
as she must always meet her antagonist bows on.</p>

<p>The steering is accomplished from the wheel house located aft on
the deck, or below deck, as all the appliances in the wheel house for
steering, &amp;c., are duplicated below. By means of a hand lever beneath
the wheel, steam is admitted to a small auxiliary engine which works
the cam that adjusts the paddles. Then by turning the horizontal
hand wheel in either direction, the helmsman controls the movement of
the cam, as desired. Just above the wheel is a dial with a pointer,
which enables him to note the position of the paddles, and so adjust
them as ordered. Inside the wheel house there are also devices for
communicating with the men working the bow gun, and with those
managing the torpedoes.</p>

<p><i>Her Armament&mdash;Engines.</i>&mdash;At <a href="#Fig_146">Fig. 146</a> is shown the spar and mode
of working it. It consists of a long hollow iron cylinder lying on its
supports between decks. Its outboard end rests in a kind of trough,
and to this extremity the torpedo is fixed. The spar is controlled by
means of tackles and a steam winch. The side spars are 18 feet, and
the bow spar 32 feet in length. If the hostile vessel is defended by
torpedo guards, by means of a mechanical contrivance the torpedo
signals the fact, and is not exploded until the vessel has forced the
obstructions. The engines of the <i>Alarm</i> are compound, with four
cylinders, the condenser being placed between them. There are four
cylindrical tubular boilers with an aggregate heating surface of 4,600
square feet. Her speed is about 16 knots. Her upper deck is only 3
feet above the water. She is fitted with an electric light, and also
with machine guns on her broadside.<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a></p>

<p>This is undoubtedly a most formidable vessel, both as a ram and a
torpedo ship, and if capable of performing all that is expected of her,
will prove a valuable addition to the United States Navy.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Captain Ericsson's Torpedo Vessel "Destroyer."</i>&mdash;This torpedo vessel
was devised and built by Captain John Ericsson. The <i>Destroyer</i> is
130 feet long, 11 feet deep, and 12 feet beam, extreme; both ends of
her hull are precisely alike, and terminate with very fine wedges.
The rudder is attached to a vertical wrought iron post welded to a
prolongation of the keel, just abaft the propeller, as shown at <a href="#Fig_147">Fig. 147</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
The tillers consist of thin plates of iron riveted on opposite sides of
the rudder, a few inches from its bottom. These tillers are operated by
straight rods connected to the pistons of horizontal hydraulic cylinders
of 5 inches diameter, which are attached to the sides of the keel.
The steering gear by the above arrangement is placed 10 feet below
the water line, while the top of the rudder is 6 feet below the same,
and thus perfect security is afforded to this most important feature of
a torpedo vessel. The intention of the designer in constructing this
vessel is to render her so far impregnable, that in attacking bow on she
can defy the opponent's fire, at the same time offering absolute protection
to her commander and steersman, and also protecting the base
of her funnel. The leading feature of the construction of the hull of
the <i>Destroyer</i> is its being provided with an intermediate curved
deck, which extends from stem to stern, and which is composed of
plate iron strongly ribbed, and perfectly water-tight. This intermediate
deck supports a heavy solid armour plate, fixed transversely to the line
of keel, and 32 feet from the bow, inclined at an angle of 45°, and supported
on its after side by a wood backing 4 feet 6 inches in thickness.
Behind this formidable shield the steering wheel is manipulated, a
wire rope extending from its barrel to a four-way cock placed near the
stern, by means of which water pressure is admitted alternately to the
hydraulic cylinders, previously mentioned, the motion of whose pistons
actuate the rudder. The lower division of the vessel is ventilated by
powerful blowers, and contains the machinery; it also affords a safe
retreat for the crew during the attack. The upper division is filled
with blocks of cork, excepting a small part near the bow, occupied by
the aforesaid armour plate and wood backing.</p>

<p>The deck house is 70 feet long, and composed of plate iron,
riveted water-tight to the upper part of the hull. As there are no
openings in the sides of this deck house, the vessel may be run with
her upper deck under water.</p>

<p><i>Armament of the "Destroyer."</i>&mdash;The <i>Destroyer</i> is to be armed with
torpedoes somewhat similar to the projectile torpedo, drawings of
which were submitted by Captain Ericsson, the inventor, to Emperor
Napoleon III. in 1854. The present weapon is composed of a solid
block of light wood, the explosive charge being contained in a
metallic vessel inserted at its forward end. Instead of being circular,
as was the case with the original torpedo, its transverse section<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
is square, with parallel top and bottom and vertical sides, forming
very sharp wedges at both ends, cased with steel plates. The
extreme length of the <i>Destroyer</i> torpedo is 23 feet. Ignition is
effected by means of a percussion fuze placed in the head of the
weapon.</p>

<p><i>Operating the Torpedo.</i>&mdash;The method of operating the torpedo is
that of inserting it into a horizontal tube near the bottom of the
vessel, provided with valves for keeping out the sea during the process
of insertion, as shown at <a href="#Fig_148">Fig. 148</a>. When near the hostile vessel, this
valve is opened, and the torpedo expelled by a piston actuated by
steam power, the expulsion being effected without recourse to gunpowder
or other explosive agent. The area of the actuating piston of
the <i>Destroyer</i> is 314 square inches, while the sectional area of the
projectile is only 196 square inches; this difference in size of the two
areas is a special and important feature of the invention, as will be
understood from the following: the tension of the acting medium
in the <i>Destroyer</i> exceeds 200 lbs. per square inch, therefore the
torpedo will be pushed out by a force of (314 × 200) / 196 = 320 lbs. per
square inch, and as the distance passed by the piston while impelling
the torpedo is 30 feet, an energy of nearly 2,000,000 foot-pounds will
be imparted to the projectile.</p>

<p>When making an attack, it is intended that the vessel should at
the instant of firing her torpedo reverse her engines, this retrograde
motion being greatly assisted by the recoil, which must attend the
discharge of a body weighing some 1,400 lbs. impelled by the aforesaid
enormous force, and moving through a distance of 30 feet before
reaching the water.<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></p>

<p>Certainly this new system of submarine attack seems feasible,
but it has yet to prove, in common with all other new inventions,
whether its theoretical capabilities are also practical ones. At <a href="#Fig_149">Fig.
149</a> is shown a general view of this novel torpedo vessel under weigh.</p>

<img src="images/i_268.jpg" width="600" height="377" alt="Plate XLVI" /><a id="Plate_XLVI"></a>
</div>

<p><i>Torpedo Boats.</i>&mdash;In offensive torpedo warfare, whether using the
spar, locomotive, or towing torpedo, especially in the case of the
former class of submarine weapons, to ensure a successful attack it is
absolutely essential to operate those weapons from steam boats, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
are capable of fulfilling as near as possible the conditions herein
enumerated:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;They should be capable of steaming at least 18 knots per
hour.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;Their engines should be noiseless, and easily managed.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;They should be extremely handy.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;No smoke should enable their approach to be detected, or glare
from their fires.</div>

<div class='hang2'>5.&mdash;That it should be possible to raise steam in them in a few
minutes.</div>

<div class='hang2'>6.&mdash;They should be built in water-tight compartments, and covered
fore and aft to prevent being swamped.</div>

<div class='hang2'>7.&mdash;The crews should be protected as far as practicable from rifle
fire.</div>

<p>In addition to the foregoing, for the purpose of rendering these
craft capable of defending themselves against the attack of guard
boats, and also of being employed as such, and on river expeditions,
&amp;c., they should be built sufficiently strong to enable them to carry
a small gun either in the bows or stern; this would apply more
especially to those torpedo boats which are part of a ship's stores.</p>

<p>During the last four years a very large number of torpedo boats
have been built, which more or less fulfil the aforesaid conditions,
nearly the whole of which have been constructed by the two English
firms, viz. Messrs. Thornycroft and Co. and Messrs. Yarrow and Co.,
and to the latter firm is due the honour of constructing the fastest
vessel as yet in the world.</p>

<p>Up to the present time, a specially built torpedo boat has on only
one occasion been used on active service, viz. at the attack on a
Turkish monitor on the 20th of June, 1877, which is detailed at length
in the following chapter. This boat was one of Messrs. Thornycroft and
Co.'s launches, and from all accounts she behaved wonderfully well
under the most untoward circumstances.</p>

<p><i>Thornycroft Torpedo Launches.</i>&mdash;Messrs. Thornycroft and Co., of
Chiswick, London, have during the last six years built a large
number of torpedo launches for the English government and for
several of the principal European governments.</p>

<p><i>Norwegian Launch.</i>&mdash;The first torpedo boat ever built by this
firm was the one shown at <a href="#Fig_150">Fig. 150</a>, for the Norwegian government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
This boat was 57 feet in length by 7 feet 6 inches beam, drew 3 feet of
water, and the stipulated speed was 16 English statute miles, or nearly
14 knots per hour; which speed was not to be ascertained by a mere
measured mile trial, but was to be 16 miles through the water in a run
of one hour's duration.</p>

<p>The hull of the vessel was constructed entirely of steel plates and
angle bars, and, as may be seen from the diagram, was divided into six
water-tight compartments, <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>E</i>, <i>F</i>.</p>

<p>The compartments marked <i>A</i> and <i>F</i> in the stem and stern were for
stores; those marked <i>B</i> and <i>E</i> were fitted with seats for the crew,
and were provided with movable steel covers, so that on going into
action, or during rough weather, they might be completely covered.</p>

<p>The compartments <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> are for the steersman and the machinery
respectively, and were covered completely by steel plating 3/16 of an inch
in thickness&mdash;a thickness sufficient to withstand Snider or Martini-Henry
bullets, fired from a distance of twenty paces.</p>

<p>The compartment <i>D</i> was furnished with a hood, having slits 1/4 of
an inch wide, all round, through which the steersman could see with
sufficient distinctness to direct his course easily. Motion was communicated
from the wheel to the tiller by means of steel wire ropes,
which it was originally intended should be encased in wrought iron
tubes.</p>

<p>The possibility however of these tubes being bent by a shot, and so
jamming the wire ropes, led to this arrangement being abandoned,
and the ropes were simply run through eyes at intervals along the
side.</p>

<p>The armament consisted of a cylindro-conical shaped torpedo
towed from the top of the funnel, round which a ring was fitted with
two pulleys for the towing rope, the strain being taken off by means
of two stays attached forward.</p>

<p>The length of this torpedo was 13 feet and the diameter 9 inches,
and with a speed of 11 knots it has diverged to about 40 degrees from
the direction of the boat's motion when running in smooth water.</p>

<p>The torpedo is worked by means of a small winch and brake fixed
on the after part of the engine room skylight; davits are provided for
dropping the torpedo overboard.</p>

<p>The engines were compound, of the usual inverted double cylinder
direct acting type, capable of developing about 90 indicated horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
power, and were fitted with a surface condenser, so that the vessel
could run in salt water, without danger of injuring her boiler.</p>

<p>A small tank contained a supply of fresh water, to make good
deficiencies arising through leakage, and from steam escaping at the
safety valves, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The circulating, air, and feed pumps were driven by a separate
engine.</p>

<p>The boiler was of the locomotive type, the shell being made of
Bessemer steel; the fire box and its stays of copper, and the tubes of
solid drawn brass.</p>

<p>On the official trial, which took place on the Thames on the 17th of
October, 1873, the number of revolutions done in the hour was found
to be 27,177, and the number required to do a mile in still water was
1578. The distance run in the hour was then, 27,177/1578 = 17·22, or very
nearly 17-1/4 miles.</p>

<p>The steam pressure during the trial averaged 85 lbs. per square
inch, and the vacuum 25-1/2 inches.</p>

<p><i>Swedish and Danish Boats.</i>&mdash;Boats of the same size and similar in all
particulars to the foregoing one&mdash;excepting the engines, which are
improved by driving the air pump, feed pump, and circulating pumps
off the main engines, and abolishing the auxiliary engine, which performed
these duties in the case of the Norwegian boat&mdash;were made for
the Swedish and Danish governments. The result was an increase of
speed to 17·27 miles in the case of the Swedish boat, and to 18·06
miles, or 15-5/8 knots, in the case of the Danish boat.</p>

<p>There is no information regarding the armament of the Swedish
boat, but the Danish boat was armed with two spindle-shaped torpedoes
12 feet long and 11-1/2 inches diameter, somewhat like the Whitehead
torpedo. They were placed on deck longitudinally near the funnel,
so as to facilitate launching, and were arranged to be towed from an
upright pole 8 feet high, placed about 6 feet from the stem.</p>

<p>A small winch was fixed on either side aft, to pay out the towing
line, and to bring back the torpedo. By these arrangements the
torpedo could be projected at a large angle from the direction of the
boat's motion, and at considerable velocity. The speed of the boat
when towing one of these torpedoes is about 10 knots.</p>

<p><i>Austrian and French Boats.</i>&mdash;The next size of torpedo vessel is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
supplied to the Austrian and French governments, which is shown at
<a href="#Fig_151">Fig. 151</a>. The dimensions are:&mdash;length, 67 feet; beam, 8 feet 6
inches; draught of water, 4 feet 3 inches. The guaranteed speed in
the case of the Austrian boat was 15 knots in a run of one hour's
duration, and in the case of the French boats 18 knots, in a run of two
hours' duration. These boats were built of somewhat thicker plating
than the 57 feet type, and the armour was extended.</p>

<p>They were divided into six water-tight compartments, and they
differed from the Scandinavian boats in having the spaces forward and
aft of the machinery permanently decked, instead of being covered
with movable steel covers only.</p>

<p>The machinery was somewhat similar to that in the Scandinavian
boats, excepting that the engines were capable of developing 200
indicated horse power, and that the air was supplied to the furnace by
being forced into an air-tight stoke hole, instead of being forced directly
under the fire grate.</p>

<p>The armament of these vessels consisted of two torpedoes attached
to the end of wooden poles, 4-1/2 inches diameter and about 43 feet long,
connected to the battery by insulated wires, and arranged to be fired
either by coming in contact with the enemy's vessel or at any distance
from it, at the will of the operator.</p>

<p>The torpedoes themselves were simply copper cases, of sufficient
size, in the case of the Austrian boat, to contain 11,000 cubic centimetres
of explosive, and in the case of the French boats, to contain 25
kilogrammes of dynamite.</p>

<p>The mode of arranging the wires is similar to that explained at
<a href="#Page_155">page 155</a>. The method of manipulating the torpedo poles consists of
two tubes riveted together at right angles, so as to form something
like the letter T. The torpedo pole is put through the horizontal tube,
which is free to move round the centre of the vertical tube, and the
vertical tube is free to move through a quarter circle at right angles to
the centre line of the vessel.</p>

<p>In attacking in front, the vertical tube is laid over till it is parallel
to the water surface, and the horizontal tube is allowed to incline
sufficiently far to allow of the end of the pole, when run out, to be
depressed from 8 to 10 feet below the water-line. It is held in this
position by a pair of blocks attached to the top of a short mast.</p>

<p>In attacking on the broadside, the vertical tube is laid over till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
it assumes a position such as to allow of the pole, when swung round,
to touch an enemy's vessel at about 8 or 10 feet below the water line.</p>

<p>The speed trials of the Austrian boat took place on the 11th of
September, 1875, when she did 24,700 revolutions on her hour's run on
the Thames, and the number of revolutions required to do a knot in
still water was found to be 1357. This gives the distance run in the
hour as 18·202 knots, or 3·202 knots over the contract speed. The
steam pressure averaged 105 lbs. per square inch, and the vacuum 25-1/2
inches during the run.</p>

<p>In the case of the French boats, the total number of revolutions
done in the two hours' run in the roadstead off Cherbourg was
49,818, and the number required to do a knot in still water was found
to be 1382, so that the distance run in the two hours was 36·05 knots,
or just over the contract speed. During the two hours, the average
steam pressure was 108 lbs. per square inch, and the vacuum 25 inches.</p>

<p>The Austrian boat was sent to her destination on board a steamer,
but the French boats, under the command of an experienced captain,
steamed by themselves from Chiswick to Cherbourg, not crossing at the
nearest points and running along the shore, but going boldly from
Dover direct to Cherbourg.</p>

<p>Shortly after the arrival of the French boats in Cherbourg, they
were altered so as to attack in front only, as the French authorities
found that these small vessels were better adapted for resisting the
effects of an explosion at the bow than at any other part.</p>

<p>The arrangement adopted is shown at <a href="#Fig_152">Fig. 152</a>, and consisted of a steel
pole about 40 feet in length, having one end about 6 inches diameter,
and solid, and the other about 1-1/2 inches diameter, and hollow; this
pole was mounted at its solid end on small pulleys, which ran upon two
ropes stretched fore and aft of the vessel; the other end, to which the
torpedo was attached, was led over a pulley fixed on the bow. Ropes
passing over pulleys to a windlass in the after compartment were
attached to the inboard end, and by turning the windlass the pole was
drawn backwards or forwards as required.</p>

<p>It will be observed that as the pole is drawn forward, the inboard
end being constrained to move in a line parallel to the deck, the outer
end is depressed in the water, and is so adjusted that when the pole is
run out to its full extremity, the torpedo is depressed to about 8-1/2 feet
below the water level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dutch and Italian Boats.</i>&mdash;The third size of boat built by this firm
for the Dutch and Italian governments are 76 feet long and 10 feet
beam, and are guaranteed to do a speed of 18 knots. These boats
are similar in design to the Austrian and French boats previously
described, but differ from them in having engines of 250 indicated
horse power, and in having more free board forward, so as to make
them better sea boats.</p>

<p>The Dutch type are armed with the outrigger torpedo, as fitted to
the French boats, and the Italian type with the Whitehead fish torpedo.</p>

<p><i>The "Lightning" Type of Boat.</i>&mdash;Now comes the <i>Lightning</i> type of
vessel, which is shown at <a href="#Fig_153">Fig. 153</a>. This vessel, built for the English
government, is 84 feet long over all, 10 feet 10 inches beam,
and draws about 5 feet of water. The machinery on board the
<i>Lightning</i> is similar in design to that already described, and is capable
of indicating 350 horse power. The hull of the <i>Lightning</i> is made
of heavier plating than usually employed, and her lines are fuller,
as she is intended for use in a tolerably rough sea if necessary;
and in order that she may be able to remain at sea for some time,
cabin accommodation on a scale larger than in any of the other
boats is provided for the officers and crew. The steering gear is
arranged so that the vessel may be steered from the deck, or from
the conning tower, and the usual telegraph gear is fitted to communicate
from the deck, or from the conning tower, to the engine
room.</p>

<p>The top of the conning tower is supported on three screws, so
arranged that it may be raised or lowered, and the space for sight
adjusted according to the range of vision required, or the risk to be
run from the enemy's missiles.</p>

<p>The <i>Lightning</i> is armed with fish torpedoes, which are discharged
from her deck forward by means of a discharging apparatus.</p>

<p>The torpedoes are charged with air, by means of one of Mr.
Brotherhood's air-compressing pumps.</p>

<p>The <i>Lightning</i> on her preliminary runs attained a speed on
the measured mile of 19·4 knots per hour, a speed which will be
somewhat reduced when she has her torpedoes, &amp;c., on board, but
which will then be over 18 knots per hour.</p>

<p>Several torpedo boats have been built and are in process of
construction by this firm for the English government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p><i>French Boats.</i>&mdash;The next size of boats is the 87 feet type, as shown
at <a href="#Fig_154">Fig. 154</a>. Of this type of torpedo launch several have been built
and are now under construction for the French government.</p>

<p>These vessels are 10 feet 6 inches beam; draught of water about
5 feet. They are built of heavier plating than the <i>Lightning</i>, and
are guaranteed to maintain a speed of 18 knots. The propellers in
these boats are placed in front of the rudder, so as to give increased
readiness in steering. In order to prevent oxidation as far as possible,
the plates and frames below the water line are galvanised. A spark-catching
apparatus is fitted to the base of the funnel, so as to
prevent the position of the boat being betrayed to the enemy at
night.</p>

<p>The armament of these vessels consist of an outrigger arrangement
similar to that described at <a href="#Page_167">page 167</a>. They are also well adapted for
the Whitehead torpedo. They are also provided with a strong buffer
in the bows for deadening the shock, in the event of their coming into
contact with an enemy's vessel at too high a rate of speed.</p>

<p><i>"Second Class" Boats and Mode of Manipulating the Fish Torpedoes
from them.</i>&mdash;Another type of Thornycroft torpedo boats, several of
which have been built for continental governments, and which is
termed "Second class," is shown at <a href="#Fig_155">Fig. 155</a>. These boats are 60 feet
long, 7 feet 6 inches beam, and draw some 3 feet of water; their
guaranteed speed being 16 knots per hour. The mode of carrying
the Whitehead fish torpedo, and manipulating it from such a boat
by means of Mr. J. I. Thornycroft's invention, which has been fully
described at <a href="#Page_140">page 140</a>, is shown at <a href="#Fig_155">Fig. 155</a> and <a href="#Fig_156">156</a>, where Fig. 155
represents both torpedoes housed, and <a href="#Fig_156">Fig. 156</a> one torpedo in the
firing position, the other one being housed.</p>

<p>Four of this type of Thornycroft torpedo boats were attached to
H.M.S. <i>Hecla</i> during her recent cruise in the Mediterranean, and
have been very favourably reported on as follows:&mdash;They do not suffer
from the blows of the sea, nor from the strains incident upon hoisting
in and out; nor yet when they are suspended ready for lowering, in
which latter position they have frequently remained for twenty-four
hours; that under careful management they are perfectly safe in a
heavy sea, and they possess good man&oelig;uvring powers.</p>

<p>The Thornycroft torpedo frames were found to perform well the
services for which they are intended. When proceeding at ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
speed they are nearly noiseless, and cannot be seen on a dark night
at a distance of 100 yards.</p>

<p><i>The Thornycroft Propeller.</i>&mdash;All the torpedo boats built by this
firm are fitted with the propeller invented by Mr. Thornycroft, and
which bears his name. It is a modification of what is known as the
Dundonald propeller, the principal difference being that in the Dundonald
propeller the blades are inclined backward in straight lines,
while in the Thornycroft propeller they are curved.</p>

<p><i>Experiment at Cherbourg.</i>&mdash;The following account of an experiment
which took place at Cherbourg in March 1877, whereby to test
the efficiency of a Thornycroft torpedo boat in exploding a spar
torpedo under the bottom of a vessel proceeding ahead at the time, is
taken from the <i>Times</i>, under date the 13th of March, 1877.</p>

<p>"Admiral Jaurez, who commands the squadron, ordered a disabled
ship, the <i>Bayonnaise</i>, during a rather rough sea, to be towed out by a
steamer belonging to the navy. A second lieutenant, M. Lemoinne,
was sent for, and informed that he had been selected to make the
experiment of launching the Thornycroft against the <i>Bayonnaise</i>
while both were in full sail. He accepted the mission without
hesitation, picked out two engine men and a pilot, and went down
with them into the interior of the Thornycroft, of which only a small
part was above water; this visible portion being painted of a greyish
colour, so as to be easily confused with the sea. The torpedo was
placed so as to project from the bow of the vessel, at the extremity of
which were two lateen sailyards about three metres in length. The towing
steamer then took up its position in front of the squadron, and the
Thornycroft also assumed the position assigned for it; an interval of three
or four marine miles separating the torpedo boat and the <i>Bayonnaise</i>.
On a signal being given, both were set in motion, the steamer
advancing in a straight line, and the Thornycroft obliquely, so as
to take the <i>Bayonnaise</i> in flank. The steam tug went at 14 knots
an hour, going at full speed in order to escape the Thornycroft.
The latter went at 19 knots an hour, a rate not attained by any
vessel in the squadron. The chase lasted about an hour, the squadron
keeping in the rear, so as to witness the operations. At the end of
that time the distance between the Thornycroft and the <i>Bayonnaise</i>
had sensibly diminished, and at a given moment the former, in order
to come up with the latter at the requisite distance, had to slacken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
speed to 8 knots an hour. The whole squadron watched this last
phase of the struggle with breathless interest, and people asked
themselves whether the shock of the torpedo would not infallibly
destroy the little vessel which bore it. It was feared that the lives
of the second lieutenant, Lemoinne, and his three companions were
absolutely sacrificed. However, the two vessels got visibly nearer.
All at once the Thornycroft put on a last spurt, and struck the
<i>Bayonnaise</i> with its whole force on the starboard bow. The sea was
terribly agitated, a deafening report was heard, and the <i>Bayonnaise</i>,
with a rent as big as a house, sank with wonderful rapidity. As for
the Thornycroft, rebounding by the shock about fifteen metres off,
even before the explosion occurred, it went round and round for a few
moments, and quietly resumed the direction of the squadron. No
trace remained of the <i>Bayonnaise</i>; it was literally swallowed up
by the sea."</p>

<p>The experiment was a most complete success, the torpedo boat not
being in the least degree injured.</p>

<p><i>The Power of Flotation of a Thornycroft Boat after being pierced by
a Rifle Shot.</i>&mdash;On the 5th of July, 1877, Messrs. Thornycroft and Co.
made an experiment with one of their torpedo boats to ascertain under
what conditions flotation is still retained after the boat has been
pierced by a rifle shot.</p>

<p>The torpedo boat experimented on was similar to the one which
has been described at <a href="#Page_169">page 169</a>. A Martini-Henry was fired through
her side, about a foot under water in the stoke hole. Whilst at anchor
the water entered in sufficient quantity to fill an ordinary size bucket
in twenty-five seconds, but when she was driven ahead less water
entered, and on the speed of 10 knots being reached, little or no water
entered. The hole was a little more than three quarters of an inch in
diameter.</p>

<p>The engagement on the Danube between the torpedo boat <i>Schootka</i>
and some Turkish vessels, in which the former vessel was pierced
by bullets, but yet did not sink, led to the above experiment being
carried out.</p>

<p><i>Efficiency of Thornycroft's Engines.</i>&mdash;As a practical proof of the
efficiency of the engines supplied by Messrs. Thornycroft and Co. to
their torpedo boats, a similar engine has been used for over two years to
work the various machines in connection with their works at Chiswick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Torpedo Boats built by Messrs. Yarrow and Co.</i>&mdash;Messrs. Yarrow and
Co., of the Isle of Dogs, London, are also very well-known torpedo
boat builders, and have during the last four years constructed a considerable
number of such vessels for the English and different continental
governments, and, as has been before stated, they are the
constructors of the fastest vessel in the world.</p>

<p><i>Dutch Torpedo Launch.</i>&mdash;In 1875 this firm built a torpedo launch
for the Dutch government, specially designed for ocean purposes. It
was 66 feet long, 10 feet beam, and 5-1/2 feet deep. She was driven by
a pair of inverted direct acting engines. The boiler was of the
locomotive type, with a working pressure of 140 lbs. per square inch,
and capable of exerting a force of some 200 indicated horses.</p>

<p><i>Russian Torpedo Boat.</i>&mdash;This firm also constructed for the Russian
government two torpedo steamers 85 feet in length. The guaranteed
speed of these vessels being 20 knots per hour. In 1878 the Russian
government ordered one hundred exactly similar boats to be constructed,
mostly at St. Petersburg, thus proving the high estimation held by
that government of Messrs. Yarrow and Co.'s torpedo boats.</p>

<p><i>Description of a Yarrow Torpedo Launch.</i>&mdash;<a href="#Fig_157">Figs. 157</a>, <a href="#Fig_158">158</a>, and <a href="#Fig_159">159</a>
show an elevation, section, and plan of a torpedo boat, Yarrow type,
a large number of which have been built for the Russian and other
continental governments.</p>

<p>The length of this boat is 75 feet, its beam 10 feet, and draught of
water 3 feet. She is built of steel of the best quality, no other metal
possessing the requisite strength and stiffness for scantling, and plates
of such lightness. It is divided into eight compartments by seven
transverse bulkheads, the forward and after compartments being used
for stores, the two central ones enclosing the machinery, while the
steersman and operator are placed in the compartment immediately
abaft the engines.</p>

<p>The steersman's head projects above the deck, and is protected by
a rifle proof steel truncated cone, the top part of which is movable like
the visor of a helmet. The hull is decked over from end to end with
a curved shield, the midship plating of which is capable of resisting
rifle shots, even at close quarters; its curved form being well adapted
for giving the maximum strength to the structure, and quickly frees
itself from any large body of water.</p>

</div>

<p>The propelling machinery consists of a pair of inverted compound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
condensing engines. The revolutions per minute at full speed are
about 470, and the indicated horse power about 280. The propeller is
of steel. The funnel is fixed at one side of the centre line, to be out of
the way of the bow torpedo pole and gear.</p>

<p>This type of torpedo boat attains a speed of from 17-1/2 to 18-1/2 knots
per hour.</p>

<p>The armament of some of these boats consists of three spar torpedoes,
a bow, and two quarter ones. The bow pole, which is strong and heavy,
is hauled out and in by means of a small auxiliary engine.</p>

<p>Boats similar to these, but of larger dimensions, viz. 84 feet long
and 11 feet beam, have also been constructed by this firm. Speed from
19 to 20 knots per hour.</p>

<p><i>English Torpedo Boats.</i>&mdash;The following account of two torpedo boats
which had been originally built by this firm for the Russian government,
but, owing to the proclamation issued by the English government
at this time prohibiting torpedo boats leaving England, were seized
by the Customs authorities when on the point of completion, and
were ultimately purchased by the English government, is an extract
from the <i>Times</i> under date the 4th of July, 1878.</p>

<p>"These vessels are each 85 feet long with 11 feet beam, and draw,
when fully equipped for service, an average of 3 feet of water. They
are strongly constructed of steel, and are fitted with compound surface
condensing engines capable of indicating 420 horse power. The high
pressure steam cylinder of these engines is 12-1/2 inches in diameter, and
the low pressure 21-1/2 inches, both having a 12 inch stroke. These
boats are at present known by their builders' numbers, one being No.
419 and the other No. 420. The former is propelled by a three-bladed
screw, 5 feet 6 inches diameter and 5 feet pitch; and the latter by a
two-bladed screw of similar proportions. Messrs. Yarrow adopt supplementary
engines for driving the air pump, circulating pump, and
feed pumps; they consider this plan preferable to that of working these
pumps direct off the main engine, as is sometimes done. One advantage
in having separate pumping engines is that, whether the vessel is
in motion or stationary, a powerful means is available for pumping her
out, should the necessity arise. It is estimated by her builders that if
the air pump and circulating pump were both utilised for this purpose,
the water could be pumped out as fast as it could enter either of these
vessels through one hundred holes made in the skin by Martini-Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
rifle bullets. If this is the case, these craft may be deemed safe from
sinking so long as their machinery is working efficiently. The boiler
is of the locomotive type, placed in the forward part of each vessel,
and has a closed stoke hole. In connection with the boiler a very
important improvement has been introduced by Messrs. Yarrow. This
consists in a means of rendering the closed stoke hole safe for the men
in the event of the collapse of a boiler tube&mdash;a contingency which cannot
be absolutely guarded against. Its efficiency was proved beyond
all question upon a previous trial of one of these boats. This was No.
419, which was tried on the 24th of May last under the supervision of
the Admiralty officials. Upon that occasion an accidental rupture of
one of the boiler tubes occurred nearly at the close of the runs over the
measured mile, which so far had been very successful. When the
boiler tube gave way the steam rushed out of the foremost hatchway
from the compartment in which the smoke box end of the boiler is
situated, and soon after from the two funnels. The men in the stoke
hole, however, being shut off from the boiler, were uninjured, and
remained at their post several minutes after the first outburst of steam.
The accident, although an untoward event, was considered by the
Admiralty officials as affording a highly satisfactory proof of the
efficiency of Mr. Yarrow's invention.</p>

<p>"The engines are placed amidships, and each vessel has spacious
cabin accommodation aft, as it is intended that they may be used either
as despatch or torpedo boats. For the latter purpose the cabin framings
above deck are removed and replaced by steel plating. They are
steered from the cabin, there being a look-out for the steersman just
above deck level. The deck is clear of all obstructions, the two funnels
being placed one on either side. They are fitted with balanced
rudders and steer well, answering their helms very quickly."</p>

<p>The trials of these two torpedo boats are taken from the <i>Engineer</i>
under date the 19th of July, 1878. At that time these boats completely
eclipsed in speed everything that had hitherto been done. At <a href="#Fig_160">Fig.
160</a> is shown in elevation this type of torpedo launch.</p>

<p>"The trials were personally conducted by Mr. Yarrow, under the
superintendence of the authorities from Whitehall, and consisted in a
two hours' run without stopping, during which time the boats were
tested at the measured mile at Long Reach. Each boat was run six
times over the mile, three runs with the tide and three runs against it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
The boats and machinery are similar in every respect, excepting that
No. 419 is fitted with a three-bladed propeller, and No. 420 a two-bladed
one, their diameters and pitch being the same in both cases.
The weights on board were accurately weighed, and amounted to 6 tons
in each boat, including coals, water, crew, and ballast.</p>

<p><i>Spanish Torpedo Boat.</i>&mdash;The following description of a torpedo boat
built by this firm for the Spanish government, enumerating all the improvements
that have of late been effected in the construction of such
vessels by members of this firm, is taken from the <i>Engineering</i> under
date the 21st of February, 1879.</p>

<p>"The alterations have a twofold character, and have reference to the
arrangements for discharging the products of combustion from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
furnaces and to those for steering the vessel. In brief, the boat is
funnelless and is fitted with two rudders, one at each end. The main
object in dispensing with the funnel is to enable the torpedo boat to
approach as closely as possible to an enemy without being seen, a
secondary, although still an important, consideration, being the absence
of any obstruction to the steersman's view, such as a funnel on deck.
The outlets for the smoke in the present instance are two ports, one on
either side of the vessel, and placed about 15 feet in from the bow.
Each of these smoke ports is fitted with a damper, and the smoke can
be turned through either or both of the passages as desired. The
control of these dampers is given to the steersman, who, on approaching
an enemy, can direct the products of combustion through the port on
the unexposed side of the vessel. The emission of smoke by day and
of the glare and sparks by night are thus to a very large extent
hidden from view, thus enabling the torpedo boat to approach very
closely to the point of attack without being observed. The outlets are
fitted with valves which are kept open by the blast, but which close
on being struck by a passing wave. Should the vessel have to be out
when a heavy sea is running the ports are closed, and a spare funnel is
rigged up on deck, on one side. Although the smoke ports are placed
forward in this boat, it is intended to place them aft in the next that
Messrs. Yarrow build, as that arrangement will obviate the inconvenience
at present experienced by those on deck from the heated gases
of the furnace being carried along it at times by the wind, when on a
certain course.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="Fig_162"></a><a id="Fig_161"></a><a id="Fig_160"></a>
<div class="caption"><a href="images/i_290-big.jpg">YARROW'S TORPEDO BOATS.</a></div>
<img src="images/i_290.jpg" width="600" height="379" alt="Plate L" /><a id="Plate_L"></a>
</div>

<p>"The steering powers of the boat have next had attention from
Messrs. Yarrow, and they have sought to remedy the defective steering
common to these large quick-speed torpedo craft. To do this they have
fitted the vessel under notice with two balanced rudders, one of which
is placed forward about 10 feet from the bow, and the other in its usual
position at the stern with the screw abaft it. Both rudders are connected
with the same steering gear, and are operated simultaneously by
one steersman. The forward rudder can be raised out of the water into
a casing inside the boat if desired by means of a screw cut on the
upper part of its spindle. By the same means, by unscrewing the
collar on the spindle, the rudder can be released and dropped into the
water should the necessity arise for so doing, by reason of its becoming
fouled or damaged. In trials which have been made with this double-steering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
system, it has been found that when steaming at high speeds
the forward rudder has a much greater control over the motion of the
boat than the stern one. The reason assigned for this is that at high
speeds the forward part of the boat is lifted out of the water, and consequently
offers a diminished side resistance to any turning motion
brought to bear upon it.</p>

<p>"The boat in which these improvements have been introduced is 86
feet long by 11 feet beam and 5 feet 6 inches deep. She is fitted with
compound engines having 22 inch and 12-1/2 inch cylinders, with a 12
inch stroke, and making 520 revolutions per minute when running at
full speed. She is propelled by a three-bladed screw 5 feet 6 inches in
diameter and 5 feet pitch. Put through some evolutions with the
view of testing her steering powers, the double rudder arrangement was
found to answer exceedingly well, and she turned a circle of a diameter
equal to about three times her own length in 1 minute 15 seconds.
She turned equally well either going ahead or astern, and in fact
her steering capabilities were satisfactorily demonstrated. The new
arrangement for carrying off the smoke also answered very well, with
the exception that the heated gases occasionally swept the deck, which
objectionable result will be avoided in future boats."</p>

<p>These boats are to be armed with spar torpedoes, and with the
Whitehead fish torpedo, the cradles and fittings for which are shown
at <a href="#Fig_161">Fig. 161</a>.</p>

<p><i>The Fastest Vessel in the World.</i>&mdash;Another type of torpedo boat, of
which one of the same dimensions has been built by this firm for the
English government, is shown at <a href="#Fig_162">Fig. 162</a>. This vessel is as yet the
fastest vessel in the world. The trials with this boat were made in
March of this year, and were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>giving as a mean 21·93 knots per hour, or 25-1/4 statute miles. The boat
was fully equipped for active service, i.e. with a load of 6-3/4 tons on board.
It was found during the trial that at speeds of 17 and 19 knots the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
vibration of the boat was considerable, but when running over 20 knots
it was hardly perceptible; the excessive vibration taking place when
the revolutions of the engines became a multiple of the natural
vibration of the boat.</p>

<p>Torpedo boats are at the present time being built by this firm for
the English, French, Spanish, Austrian, and Italian governments.</p>

<p><i>Russian Torpedo Boats, built by Mr. S. Schibau, Prussia.</i>&mdash;Mr. S.
Schibau, of Elbing, Eastern Prussia, in 1878 constructed ten torpedo
boats for the Russian government, similar to the one shown at Fig 163.</p>

<p>These boats are each 66 feet long, and 11 feet 3 inches beam.
They are built of steel plates about an eighth of an inch thick. Their
engines consist of three cylinder compounds, with surface condensers;
and they run at 380 revolutions per minute, at full speed, driving a
screw 4 feet in diameter. They have been variously armed, some with
the spar, some with the Whitehead fish, and some with the Harvey
towing torpedo. Their speed is about 18 knots per hour.</p>

<p><i>Messrs. Herreshoff's Torpedo.</i>&mdash;Messrs. Herreshoff, of Rhode Island,
U.S.A., have also constructed several torpedo boats. One of these,
built for the English government, is shown in section at <a href="#Fig_164">Fig. 164</a>.
This boat is 59 feet 6 inches long, 7 feet 6 inches beam, and 5 feet
6 inches deep; she draws about 1 foot 3 inches of water.</p>

beneath the vessel in a central position, and which is driven by a direct
acting condensing engine placed in the forward part of the boat. The
diameters of the steam cylinders are 10-1/2 inches and 6 inches respectively,
with 10 inch stroke, and they are of 100 horse power estimated. There
is an independent feed pump and air pump. The stoke hold is enclosed
and is supplied with air by a Sturtevant blower, which is driven by an
independent engine of 2-1/2 horse power. The propeller is a two-bladed
screw 38 inches in diameter and 5 feet pitch, the screw shaft being 23 feet
in length. The vessel is steered by means of a balanced rudder placed
a short distance from the stern and under the ship, the helmsman being
located in a stern cabin with a protected look-out raised just above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
deck. The hull and machinery together weigh 6 tons, but with the
working crew of four men and fuel, stores, and two torpedoes on board,
boat weighs about 7-1/2 tons.</p>

<p>"Steam is supplied by a Herreshoff coil boiler, which constitutes
another novelty in this boat. This boiler consists of a circular combustion
chamber, which in the present instance is 4 feet in diameter
internally, and within which is a coil of about 300 feet of 2 inch pipe
coiled to nearly the diameter of the chamber. This coil is continued
at the top so as to form a kind of dome under the cover of the combustion
chamber. By the side of the boiler is a separator, into which the steam
passes before it goes to the engine. The water from the feed pump is
admitted at the top of the coil, and during its course to the bottom the
greater portion of it becomes converted into steam. Having passed
through the entire length of the coil, the steam and water are discharged
together into the separator in such a manner that the water is
entirely separated from the steam, and can be blown off as required.
The steam is taken from the top of the separator, and returns through
a short coil placed inside the combustion chamber, where it becomes
superheated, and is led thence to the engines. It is claimed for this
boiler that it cannot explode destructively, inasmuch as there is but a
very small quantity of water in it at any time, and that it is distributed
along the entire length of the coil. A rupture at any point would
only be attended by a moderate blowing off of steam. The rapid
circulation of the water is found to prevent the deposit of salts, the
surplus water not converted into steam carrying with it all impurities.
A good working pressure can be obtained within a few minutes of lighting
the fire, and the boiler can be blown off in a few seconds. The large
combustion chamber enables the full economy of the fuel to be
realised."<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a></p>

<p>This vessel is guaranteed for a speed of 16 knots per hour. She
can be propelled ahead or astern with equal speed, and can be brought
to a dead stop when going full speed within a distance equal to her
own length. Her turning powers are equally good. Her armament
will probably be the fish torpedo.</p>

<p><i>Ordinary Torpedo Boat.</i>&mdash;The most efficient and simple method of
fitting and working a spar torpedo from an ordinary steam launch or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
pinnace is shown at <a href="#Fig_165">Fig. 165</a>. This method will be readily understood
from the figure; the dotted lines show the position of the spar and
upright, when rigged in. The speed of this type of torpedo boat
ranges from 6 to 9 knots. Occasions would no doubt occur in time
of war when a torpedo attack by such boats would be a feasible
matter, and therefore everything should be done to render these
boats fit for that special service.</p>

<p><i>Defects.</i>&mdash;The most important defects of such craft are:&mdash;</p>


<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;The noise created by their engines, thus rendering an undetected
approach to a hostile vessel impracticable.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;Their liability to be swamped by the explosion of the torpedo.</div>

<p>Of course there are many minor defects, but above are the principal
ones, both of which might, to a considerable extent, be modified.</p>

<p><i>Torpedo Boat Attacks.</i>&mdash;It is impossible to attempt more than a very
general idea of how to conduct a torpedo boat attack, as so much depends
upon the circumstances, ever changing, under which each particular
attack would have to operate.</p>

<p>The spar and the fish torpedo are the submarine weapons that can
best be manipulated from boats, the towing torpedo requiring a more
roomy craft than the torpedo boat generally is to operate it from with
any chance of success.</p>

<p><i>Methods of Protecting Ships from Boat Torpedo Attacks.</i>&mdash;The principal
methods that exist at the present time of protecting a ship from a boat
torpedo attack are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;Booms by themselves, or supporting nets hung vertically,
surrounding the ship at a distance of 10 or 15 feet from
the side of the vessel.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;A crinoline of wire, or chain, fixed by stays to the vessel's side,
but capable of being lifted out of the water if required.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;The above methods supplemented by guard boats, and a cordon
of boats.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;A cordon of boats, that is, boats connected at certain distances
by means of hawsers, or chain cables, and at a distance of
some 200 or 300 yards from the vessel, supplemented by
guard boats, but without other protection.</div>

<div class='hang2'>5.&mdash;Electric lights and torpedo guns. These latter are small
guns capable of penetrating the side of a torpedo boat and
of being depressed at a very small angle.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>As it is against these defences that torpedo boats would have to
contend, therefore they have been described previous to explaining the
mode of conducting a torpedo boat attack.</p>

<p>The first two methods of defence are of course quite impracticable
when the attacked vessel is one of a blockading squadron, and it is
against such vessels that a torpedo boat attack will generally be
used and oftenest be successful.</p>

<p>In the case of a vessel forced to anchor in a harbour which is
accessible to the torpedo boats of the enemy, by the application of
either of the first two methods, supplemented by guard boats and
electric lights, she would undoubtedly be almost impregnable against
a torpedo boat attack, even were the boats armed with the fish torpedo,
though she would of course not be in that state of readiness which is
essential to a man-of-war's efficiency. As a general rule, no man-of-war
should anchor unless absolutely necessary in the vicinity of an
enemy's ports, and then should retain the power of moving in any
direction in the quickest space of time possible, using the electric
light and guard boats as a means of protection.</p>

<p>An attack by boats armed with the spar torpedo must always
partake of the nature of a forlorn hope, this especially applying to the
boats themselves, the crews of which, provided they are supplied with
good life belts, would seem to run a far greater risk of a wetting and
a prison than of being shot.</p>

<p>Not less than four torpedo boats should compose the attacking
force. The crews of the boats, consisting of only those actually
required, should fully understand "<i>that the hostile vessel is to be
torpedoed</i>," i.e. they are not to give up the attack on the vessel
opening fire, nor in the case of one or more of the torpedo boats being
sunk, but to remember that one boat is sufficient to effectually carry
out the object of the attack, viz. the sinking of the ship.</p>

<p>In making the attack, one boat should be directed on each bow,
and one on each quarter, the final rush being as combined as possible.
There must not be the <i>slightest hesitation</i>, and each boat must make
<i>direct</i> for her point of attack.</p>

<p>The cause of the Russians failing so often in their torpedo boat
attacks during the war of '77 may be traced to the absence of anything
like a system, and to their giving up the attack directly they supposed
themselves discovered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>When using the towing torpedo, two boats only could be used, and
they should make the attack, either coming down from ahead, one
on each side of the vessel, or coming up from the stern, one on each
side of the vessel, or by the boats crossing the bow and stern of the
vessel in different directions.</p>

<p>In the case of the fish torpedo the attack must be conducted in a
different manner, the object in this case being to get within a certain
distance only of the vessel undetected, and from thence send the
missile on its deadly course. The distance should not be more than
500 yards; the closer up to 200 yards the better. In connection with
such an attack, the torpedo boats might be supported by guard
boats, whose particular duty it would be to engage the enemy's guard
boats and so leave the torpedo boats free to do their particular work.</p>

<p>It has been suggested to use the electric light from the bows of
torpedo boats, but this would do away with one of the chief characteristics
of such boats, viz. their invisible and unknown approach, on
which the whole success of the attack in a great measure depends.</p>

<p><i>Fosberry's Patent Torpedo Boat Protective.</i>&mdash;To enable torpedo
vessels and boats to remain afloat after being struck by shot from
mitrailleuses, rifles, and other arms usually employed against such
craft, and at the same time to retain their structural lightness, Colonel
G. V. Fosberry, of the English army, has designed the following method,
which is based upon the discovery that when india-rubber or the like
is placed and secured on a metal plate, and is penetrated or punctured
by a rifle bullet or similar projectile, which also passes through the
metal plate, the hole or orifice so formed in the india-rubber will,
after the projectile has passed through it and the metal plate, immediately
be closed by the elasticity of the surrounding portions, so that
no water can follow the projectile through the said hole or orifice.
India-rubber or other elastic material, or a combination of such
materials, in the form of sheets, belts, or coats, is placed upon or
around those portions of the hull of the boat which are to be protected.
Vulcanised or mineralised india-rubber is the material usually
employed by Colonel Fosberry. Between the metal plates and the
india-rubber covering an intermediate substance, generally kamptulicon,
is interposed, which is cemented or riveted to the said metal
plates, and to which the india-rubber is attached. This intermediate
substance, which is the feature of the invention, must be of such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
nature that it may be caused to adhere closely and tightly to all parts
of the metal, and also to the india-rubber covering, while the same
are unperforated, but when the said india-rubber covering and the
metal plate under the same are perforated by a bullet, the portion of
the said intermediate substance adjacent to the perforation must be
detached from the elastic covering and metal plate, and leave the
former free to act like a valve, and close up over the hole so that no
water may enter; and this intermediate substance, as applied by the
inventor in the immediate vicinity of the perforation, will by the
effect of the shot be so broken up and detached from the india-rubber
covering as to allow the same to recover its original position independently
of the new shape or position of the injured and deformed
metal plate.</p>

<p>Should the india-rubber be placed upon the metal plates and be
so attached to the said plates as to adhere and conform to them in or
after their deformation, a hole made in the india-rubber would remain
open; on the other hand, should the india-rubber without any intermediate
substance be attached to the metal plate in such a manner
that it will recover its position after perforation, water would penetrate
between the metal and the india-rubber, and by the pressure of this
water the india-rubber would be liable to be detached from a large
area of the metal plate, and so become ineffective or even dangerous
to the boat. Moreover, if the india-rubber is fixed directly upon the
metal plates, in the case of a shot passing completely through the
boat, that is to say, passing into the boat at one side and out at the
other side, a large portion of the india-rubber adjacent to the hole
made by the shot in leaving the boat will be torn or destroyed, but
this will not be the case in boats constructed according to Colonel
Fosberry's patent.</p>

<p>The French government have recently applied this invention to
one of their torpedo boats with very successful results, thereby proving
that it is not merely a theoretical idea.</p>

<p><i>Submarine Boats.</i>&mdash;Submarine boats, if they could be constructed
to fulfil the conditions hereinafter enumerated which are essential to
a perfect boat of that nature, would for many reasons be a very
important point solved in connection with torpedo operations, and
therefore it is most extraordinary that a practicable submarine boat
has not yet been designed and built.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bushnell's Submarine Boat.</i>&mdash;The first submarine vessel built for
torpedo purposes was designed and constructed by David Bushnell
in 1775. This vessel, operated by a Sergeant Esra Lee, was employed
in an attempt in 1776 or thereabouts on the <i>Eagle</i>, an English
man-of-war, which proved unsuccessful, owing to the sergeant not
being thoroughly versed in the management of his curious craft. She
was soon afterwards sunk in the Hudson river, but was subsequently
recovered by the inventor, though never used again. This vessel was
capable of holding one person, and air sufficient to support him thirty
minutes without receiving fresh air, and is fully described in 'Barnes's
Submarine Warfare.'</p>

<p><i>Qualifications essential to a Submarine Boat.</i>&mdash;A submarine boat
should possess the following qualifications:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;It should be of sufficient displacement to carry the machinery
necessary for propulsion, and the men and materials for
performing the various operations.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;It should be of such a form that it may be easily propelled
and steered.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;It should have sufficient interior space for the crew to work in.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;It should be capable of carrying sufficient pure air to support
its crew for a specified time, or of having the means of
purifying the air within the boat, and exhausting the
foul air.</div>

<div class='hang2'>5.&mdash;It should be able to rise and sink at will to the required depth,
either when stationary or in motion.</div>

<div class='hang2'>6.&mdash;It should be so fitted that the crew possess the means of
leaving the boat without requiring external assistance.</div>

<div class='hang2'>7.&mdash;It should carry a light sufficient to steer by, and to carry on
the various operations.</div>

<div class='hang2'>8.&mdash;It should possess sufficient strength to prevent any chance of
its collapsing at the greatest depth to which it may be
required to manipulate it.</div>

<p>The results of former experiments with such boats prove that
manual power, which was the original mode of propulsion, is not the
motive power best adapted to such a boat; compressed air, gas as used
in the Lay torpedo boat, and steam, are all of them far preferable to
the original method, but which of these modern ones is the most
practicable has yet to be decided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>The most difficult point to be overcome in connection with a submarine
boat is that of steering it correctly when beneath the surface
of the water.</p>

<p><i>Confederate Submarine Boat.</i>&mdash;The Confederate submarine torpedo
boat that sunk the Federal vessel of war <i>Housatonic</i> on the 17th of
February, 1864, was built of boiler iron, 35' long, 3' beam (extreme),
5' high in the centre. She carried a crew of nine men. She was
propelled by means of a screw propeller worked by eight of the crew,
her greatest speed being four knots an hour in smooth water. She
carried a sufficient quantity of air to enable the crew to remain
submerged for the space of two to three hours. Two fins were fitted
on the outside for rising and falling at will, when in motion. There
were two manholes provided, fitted with bull's-eyes. This boat was
intended to pass under a vessel's bottom, towing a torpedo after her,
which was arranged to explode on contact. She was the means of
drowning fourteen men before she made her last attempt, when nine
others were added to the above list. In her successful attack on the
<i>Housatonic</i>, she was armed with the bow spar torpedo, and was sunk,
owing to her running into the hole formed by the explosion of her
torpedo. About three years after the American civil war was over,
this submarine boat was recovered. Divers went down, and found her
lying alongside the hull of the <i>Housatonic</i>, with the remains of the
nine men in her.</p>

<p><i>French Submarine Boat "Plongeur."</i>&mdash;The boat termed the <i>Plongeur</i>
was designed by Admiral Bougois and M. Brune, and was exhibited
at the Paris Exhibition of 1867. She was 26' long, 9' deep,
and fitted with centre and bilge keels. She carried two small
tanks containing compressed air, and four large tanks were placed at
the bottom of the boat for the purpose of sinking her, these latter
tanks communicating with the water outside and the air tanks. She
also was fitted with a compass for steering by, a water gauge to show
the depth of submersion, and an air gauge to show the pressure of air
in the boat. Rectangular valves were placed at the bottom of the boat
for entrance or exit therefrom, for the use of divers, and to affix
torpedoes to a ship's bottom. On the top a circular opening for
entrance and exit was arranged, also an iron cupola fitted with bull's-eyes.
She was also fitted with an apparatus for spraying water through
the air in the interior of the boat on its becoming foul, and escape valves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
for releasing any foul air were placed at the top of the boat. The
water tanks were filled by means of pumps, and emptied by means
of the compressed air. She was propelled by a three-bladed screw
worked by four men. Her rate of progression was about four knots
per hour. The anchors consisted of two 15 inch shot, fitted with wire
rope cables, working through watertight stuffing boxes.</p>

<p>This vessel has been subjected to some experiments, but with what
results is not generally known.</p>

<p>One of the most important uses to which a submarine boat would
be put in connection with torpedo operations would be "to discover
the exact position and number of an enemy's submarine mines, and if
necessary destroy them," the former being an operation in the present
day quite impossible to perform, and the latter one rarely to be
depended on.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<small>TORPEDO OPERATIONS.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>A REVIEW, however brief, of the numerous torpedo operations
that have of late years been carried out in actual war, must prove
not only of great interest, but of material aid to those who may be
desirous of studying this branch of naval warfare, for the experience
so gained ought alone to be the basis on which a system of submarine
offence and defence should be constructed.</div>

<p>No new torpedo invention should be adopted, however theoretically
perfect it may be, until it has been subjected to a very severe practical
test, under conditions as nearly analogous to those that would occur on
active service as it would be possible to obtain. The vast importance
of a carefully planned and executed system of submarine <i>defence</i> is an
established fact, and it only remains to discover what are the best
weapons for, and most practicable mode of manipulating a system of
submarine offence, to establish torpedo warfare in all its branches as a
necessary function of naval warfare.</p>

<p>It would be a mere waste of time to dwell on the Anglo-French
and American wars of the beginning of this century (1797-1812);
though during that period various attempts were made by Fulton
and others to destroy hostile vessels by means of submarine infernal
machines, inasmuch as they all partook more or less of the nature of
experiments, and were all failures, but come at once to the Crimean
war (1854-1856), when what may be termed a systematic employment
of torpedoes for harbour defence was first employed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Crimean War</span> (1854-56).</h3>

<p><i>Defence of Sebastopol Harbour, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;The Russians employed a
large quantity of submarine mines, both electrical and mechanical,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
principally the latter, in their defence of the harbours of Sebastopol,
Sveaborg, and Cronstadt.</p>

<p>According to General Delafield, U.S.A., the arrangement of the
mechanical mines was entirely new, the conception and idea of an
eminent Russian chemist, Professor Jacobi.</p>

<p><i>Electrical Mines.</i>&mdash;No mention is made by the General of the
employment of electrical mines, but the fact of a hulk being captured
by the Allies at Yenikale, with a number of torpedoes on board, and
all the arrangements necessary to explode them by electricity, such as
Voltaic piles, electric fuzes, several miles of conducting wire, &amp;c., is
sufficient proof of this type of submarine mine being extensively used
by the Russians in their harbour defences.</p>

<p>Many of their mechanical mines were picked up by the Allies,
several of which were found to have their safety caps on. Owing to
this neglect, and the smallness of the charge of the torpedoes (only
some 25 lbs. of gunpowder), it is not to be wondered at that no serious
injury was done to any ships of the allied squadron.</p>

<p>Deterred most probably by the failures of Bushnell, Fulton, and
others in previous years with the submarine and other torpedo boat
attacks, nothing of this description was attempted by either side.</p>

<p><i>Russian Mechanical Mines.</i>&mdash;The Russian mechanical mines consisted
of barrels of powder fitted with fuzes, so arranged that a blow
would smash a glass tube containing sulphuric acid, causing the acid
to mix with some chlorate of potash, resulting in combustion and the
explosion of the mine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Austro-Italian War</span> (1859).</h3>

<p><i>Defence of Venice by Von Ebner.</i>&mdash;During this brief struggle,
defensive torpedo operations were carried out under the direction of
Colonel Von Ebner, of the Imperial Austrian Engineers.</p>

<p>The harbour of Venice was protected by a most elaborate system
of submarine mines, devised by the above-named officer. Though the
importance of his system was proved by the fact of no attempt being
made on Venice, yet no opportunity was afforded of <i>practically</i> testing
its efficiency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">American Civil War</span> (1861-65).</h3>

<p><i>Cause of the Present Importance of the Torpedo.</i>&mdash;The prominent
position the torpedo now holds as a most important and legitimate
function of naval warfare is owing without doubt to the successful
and extensive employment of them on the part of the Confederates
during this long and bloody struggle.</p>

<p><i>Reasons which induced the Confederates to employ Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;The
numerous harbours and navigable rivers in the possession of the
Southerners, the few ships of war at their disposal, the overwhelming
fleet of the Northerners, and the introduction for the first time of
ironclads in naval warfare, are the principal causes which forced the
Confederates to resort to torpedoes as a means of offence and
defence.</p>

<p>Though a few rude and extempore submarine mechanical mines
were met with by the Federals during the earliest part of the war,
it was not until many months after the commencement of hostilities
that the Confederates, finding themselves quite unable to cope with
their rivals on the sea, set to work in earnest to organise a system of
submarine warfare on a grand scale.</p>

<p><i>Torpedo Corps formed, &amp;c.&mdash;Loss of "Cairo."</i>&mdash;By October, 1862,
a secret service torpedo corps, with headquarters at Richmond, was
in full swing, and the principal harbours and rivers of the Confederates
were systematically protected by means of electrical and mechanical
mines, also a scheme of offence by drifting and spar torpedoes was
in preparation, and in December of the same year they experienced
the first-fruits of their labour by the total destruction of the Federal
war steamer <i>Cairo</i>.</p>

<p>The following brief review of the numerous torpedo operations
carried out by both sides, and the effect their use had on the war, will
be sufficient to enable the general reader to gain some idea of the
vast importance of this submarine weapon in future warfare.</p>

<p>Fuller and more detailed accounts will be found in Commander
S. Barnes's, U.S.N., Colonel Von Scheliha's, and Captain H. Steward's
torpedo works.</p>

<p><i>Every Species of Torpedo used&mdash;Frame Torpedoes at Charleston, &amp;c.&mdash;Federal
Ship Disasters&mdash;Small Effect of Electrical Mines&mdash;Loss of
the "Commodore Jones," &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Every species of submarine mine seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
have been used by the Southerners for their harbour and river defence,
the most effectual of which were the barrel, frame, and Singer's
torpedoes. These were all mechanical, fired by means of sensitive
concussion fuzes. At Charleston and elsewhere the frame torpedo,
which also acted as an obstruction, was largely used, and where this
species of mine was known to be laid, the Northerners never attempted
to force a passage. Out of some thirty or forty Federal ships sunk
or injured by torpedoes, by far the larger proportion of such disasters
was effected by means of the barrel and Singer's mines. Though
electrical mines were very extensively used on the St. James River
and at Charleston, &amp;c., yet only one Federal steamer, the <i>Commodore
Jones</i>, was sunk, and only one other, the <i>Commodore Barney</i>, was
injured.</p>

<p><i>Case of the "New Ironsides."</i>&mdash;The Federal ship <i>New Ironsides</i>, at
the attack on Charleston in 1863, was anchored for one hour and a half
exactly over a 5000 lbs. electrical mine, which despite all the efforts of
the Confederates could not be exploded. The reason of this was owing
to the deterioration of the primer, due to too constant testing.</p>

<p><i>Welden Railway.</i>&mdash;A notable instance of the effect of torpedoes on
the war was the saving of the Welden line of communication in
December, 1864. The Welden Railway was the principal artery of
communication to Richmond for the Confederates. To intercept this, by
destroying the railway bridges, a fleet of nine Federal gunboats was
sent up the Roanoke river; when nearly arrived at their destination,
and though every precaution in the shape of bow projecting spars,
creeping, &amp;c., was taken, seven of the vessels were either sunk or
severely injured by submarine mines. Thus the expedition ended in a
most disastrous failure.</p>

<p><i>General Butler's Attack on Richmond.</i>&mdash;Again, in April, 1864, General
Butler's attack on Richmond utterly failed, owing to the Federal fleet
being unable to co-operate with him, the destruction of the <i>Commodore
Jones</i> completely checking any further advance of Admiral Lee's ships,
thus allowing the Confederates to employ the garrisons of their river
batteries in their land line of entrenchments.</p>

<p><i>More than One Line of Torpedoes required.</i>&mdash;The capture of the
Spanish fort at Mobile in April, 1865, by a Federal fleet under Admiral
Lee, proves the necessity of employing more than one line of torpedoes,
where the safety of a position depends almost entirely on those means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of defence, as this one did. Here, though several Federal vessels were
either sunk or severely damaged, yet the fort was captured.</p>

<p><i>Boat Torpedo Attacks.</i>&mdash;In regard to boat torpedo attacks, the Confederates
were only successful in two out of many attempts made by
them to sink Federal vessels.</p>

<p><i>The "Housatonic" and "Minnesota."</i>&mdash;These successes were the complete
destruction of the Housatonic by a submarine boat, fitted with a
spar torpedo, and serious injury caused to the <i>Minnesota</i> by the explosion
of a contact spar torpedo, carried by an ordinary gig, commonly
termed "David's." In the former instance the attacking boat was
sunk,<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> in the latter instance she was uninjured.</p>

<p><i>Destruction of the "Albemarle."</i>&mdash;On the part of the Federals,
Lieutenant Cushing with a steam launch fitted with a Wood and Lay
torpedo, succeeded in sinking the Confederate ram <i>Albemarle</i>. The
boat in this instance was swamped by the column of water thrown up
on the explosion of the torpedo, she having been driven full speed
at the Albemarle.</p>

<p><i>Ship Spar Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;On both sides, spar torpedoes fitted to the
bows of ships, and also on rafts slung over the bows, were somewhat
extensively used, but on no occasion were they the means of injuring or
sinking any vessels.</p>

<p>To increase the difficulties of the Northerners in searching for submarine
mines, the Southerners laid down a great number of dummy
torpedoes, also erected false torpedo stations, and laid false wires.</p>

<p>It must always be borne in mind, in connection with the torpedo
operations above detailed, that the apparatus were very crude, and the
operators at the commencement inexperienced.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Paraguayan War</span> (1864-68).</h3>

<p><i>Torpedoes employed by the Paraguayans.</i>&mdash;During their protracted
struggle with the Brazilians, the Paraguayans employed submarine
mines for the protection of their river forts, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Loss of the "Rio Janeiro"&mdash;Brazilian Fleet entrapped.</i>&mdash;On the 2nd
of September, 1866, the Brazilian ironclad <i>Rio Janeiro</i>, after being
well-battered by the guns of the Curupaity fort, was sunk by a torpedo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Later on, near the same place, a whole fleet of Brazilian war ships
were entrapped by the Paraguayans, between two rows of submarine
mines, but owing to faulty arrangements they escaped unharmed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Austrian War</span> (1866).</h3>

<p><i>Venice, Pola, &amp;c., protected by Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;During this war, torpedoes
for the defence of Venice, Pola, &amp;c., were extensively used by the
Austrians, under the direction of Baron von Ebner, but as in '59 no
opportunity was afforded of proving their practical worth, though
morally they were of great value, the Austrian harbours so defended
being considered impregnable by the enemy, and therefore no attempt
was made to force them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Franco-German War</span> (1870-71).</h3>

<p>Little or nothing in the matter of torpedo operations was attempted
by the Germans, and on the part of the French nothing whatever.</p>

<p><i>Germans employed Submarine Mines.</i>&mdash;Electrical and mechanical
mines were placed in several of the German harbours, the former
containing about 200 lbs. of dualine, the latter some 80 lbs. of gunpowder.
The only attempt to destroy French ships by means of
offensive torpedoes was made by the German vessel the <i>Grille</i>, off
Rügen, which resulted in failure.</p>

<p>In laying down and in picking up after the war was over their
mechanical mines, several exploded, killing some ten to fifteen men.</p>

<p><i>Boats necessary.</i>&mdash;Towards the end of the war, the Germans were
constructing special torpedo boats, believing that such were necessary
for the complete defence of harbours. This war added another proof of
the moral worth of submarine mines; the French fleet not daring to
approach German waters <i>supposed</i> to be defended by such means.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Russo-Turkish War</span> (1877-78).</h3>

<p><i>Superiority of Turkey to Russia in the matter of Ships.</i>&mdash;On the
Danube, in the Black Sea, and Mediterranean, where the principal
naval portion of the war was carried out, Turkey was possessed of a
fleet of ships infinitely superior to Russia, both in point of numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and strength, and therefore, to enable her to hold her own against this
vast superiority of the Turks, the Russians resorted to an extensive
employment of torpedoes, for both offensive and defensive purposes.</p>

<p><i>Russian Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;For many years previous to the outbreak of
hostilities in April, 1877, the Russians had been studying the subject
of torpedo warfare in all its branches, a certain number of their naval
and military officers and men having every year passed through a
regular course of torpedo study, at a school specially formed for such a
purpose; they had also laid in large stores of submarine mines, spar
torpedoes, and were in possession of the Whitehead and towing
torpedoes, and also several electric lights, and a few months after
war was declared they obtained a fast Thornycroft torpedo boat.</p>

<p><i>Turkish Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;On the other hand, the Turks were only in
possession of a number of those huge, unwieldy 500 lbs. buoyant mines,
and one electric light; circuit closers, contact mines, boats (steam or
otherwise) fitted for use with torpedo, or offensive torpedoes, being
conspicuous by their absence.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that in the matter of submarine offence and
defence, the Russians were as superior to the Turks as the latter were
to the former in the matter of ships.</p>

<p><i>Turkish Defensive Torpedo Operations.</i>&mdash;The defensive torpedo operations
carried out by the Ottoman naval officers and men were as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The harbour of Batoum in the Black Sea was protected by a few
500 lbs. buoyant mines, arranged to be fired by observation.</p>

<p>The mouth of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles were similarly
defended. For this work great praise is due to those who executed
the work, for the very strong current and great depth met with in
those waters would render such a service a work of great difficulty,
even when properly constructed mooring boats, and men trained to
such, were employed, both of which in this particular instance were
absent.</p>

<p>Soulina, one of the mouths of the Danube, and Suda Bay (Candia)
were also protected by similar means.</p>

<p><i>Russian Defensive Torpedo Operations.</i>&mdash;The Russian defensive
torpedo operations were very extensive, their principal harbours in
the Baltic, as well as those in the Black Sea, were carefully defended
by electro-contact mines of the latest type; so also they protected their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
numerous bridges across the Danube, double and sometimes treble
rows of such mines being moored on either side, and in addition they
also placed several mines in the Danube, on the chance of destroying
the Turkish Danube flotilla.</p>

<p><i>Destruction of Turkish Gunboat "Suna" by a Russian Submarine
Mine.</i>&mdash;The only instance that occurred during this war of a vessel
being sunk by a stationary submarine mine was that of the Turkish
gunboat <i>Suna</i>, at Soulina, in October, 1877, on the occasion of the
unsuccessful attack on that place made by the combined Russian and
Roumanian flotilla.</p>

<p>About 6 <span class="small">A.M.</span> on the morning of the attack, a "loftcha" containing
two of the enemy's electro-contact mines, fitted for laying down, was
captured by the Turks, from which it was evident that the Russians
had been employed during the night in torpedoing the reach immediately
above the Turkish defences. However, not heeding this
very practical warning, the Pacha in command of the Soulina
squadron ordered the <i>Kartal</i> (a paddle-wheel tug vessel) and the
<i>Suna</i> (an old wooden gunboat) to reconnoitre up the river; they
accordingly started, the <i>Kartal</i> leading the way. At 8.5 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, about
fifteen minutes after the two vessels had left their moorings, an
explosion was heard, and almost at the same instant the unfortunate
gunboat <i>Suna</i> was observed to go down head foremost, her masts
only remaining above water. The <i>Kartal</i>, which at the time of the
catastrophe was some distance in advance, at once turned back to the
assistance of her consort, and managed to save a number of the gunboat's
crew, this work having to be performed under a galling fire
from the allied flotilla. Owing to this day being the "Feast of
Bairam," the unfortunate gunboat was dressed with masthead flags,
thus four Turkish ensigns fell into the hands of the enemy, the Pacha
refusing permission for any attempt to be made to save them. The
reason that the <i>Kartal</i> escaped the fate of her consort was due to her
only drawing some 5 feet of water, while the <i>Suna</i> drew at least 8 feet.</p>

<p>The gunboat struck the mine that sunk her on her port bow, the
effect of the explosion being to completely smash in that side of her
bow, dismount her foremost guns, and carry away her foremast just
above the deck (the mast remained standing, though inclined forward);
the second lieutenant of the <i>Suna</i>, who was at the time
of the explosion standing on her fore bridge, was thrown off and killed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and some twelve of the crew were killed and wounded. To complete
the destruction of the <i>Suna</i>, another torpedo was exploded under her
port quarter by the Russians. The torpedo that was used on this
occasion is detailed at <a href="#Page_68">page 68</a>.</p>

<p><i>Offensive Torpedo Operations.</i>&mdash;The numerous boat torpedo attacks
made by the Russians against the Turkish fleet will now be considered.
The following accounts have been carefully compiled from two sources,
viz. an article written by Captain Chardonneau, which appeared in the
'Revue Maritime et Coloniale,' 1878, and which has been recently
translated for the Journal of the Royal United Service Institution by
Lieutenant J. Meryon, R.N., and notes taken by the author during his
service with the Imperial Ottoman Navy (1877-78).</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">1st Affair.</span></h3>

<p><i>The Batoum Attack.</i>&mdash;The first torpedo boat attack occurred on the
night of the 12th-13th of May at Batoum.<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a></p>

<p>On the night of the attack there were lying in the harbour several
vessels of the Ottoman fleet, including ironclads, transports, despatch-boats,
&amp;c. These vessels were totally unprotected by guard boats,
booms, electric lights, &amp;c., and only the usual number of sentries were
posted, the Turks at that time not quite believing in such boat attacks,
thus offering peculiar advantages for a torpedo attack.</p>

<p>Four torpedo boats formed the attacking force, viz. the <i>Tchesme</i>,
<i>Sinope</i>, <i>Navarino</i>, and the <i>Soukoum Kalé</i>.</p>

<p>These boats were carried by a ship of the Maritime Company of
Odessa, named <i>Grand Duke Constantine</i>. She was an iron screw
steamer, able to steam about 10 knots per hour, and fitted to hoist
up the above-mentioned torpedo boats. She was armed with four
4-pounders, and torpedoes.</p>

<p>Early in the evening of the 12th the <i>Constantine</i> left Poti, and
proceeded off the harbour of Batoum, her captain (Lieutenant de
Vaisseau Makaroff) deeming it advisable to lay to seven miles from the
harbour, the supposition that the Turks had placed submarine mines
off the entrance being the cause of his so doing.</p>

<p>About 11 <span class="small">P.M.</span> the four torpedo boats started to the attack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Makaroff being in command of one of them. They were all painted
sea green, and possessed a high speed. The night being dark, and
having been despatched some distance off, they reached the entrance in
somewhat straggling order. The <i>Tchesme</i>, commanded by Lieutenant
Zatzarennyi, and armed with a towing torpedo, was the first to enter
the harbour, and, without waiting for her consorts, dashed at the Ottoman
fleet, and succeeded in getting close to a large Turkish paddle-wheel
transport, and her commander dipping his torpedo, struck the ship under
her quarter; but that little something which so often causes a failure
in this mode of warfare occurred, and no explosion followed the
pressing down of the firing key, much to the chagrin and disgust of
Zatzarennyi. As might be supposed, by this time an alarm had
been raised, and guns, rifles, &amp;c., were fired in and from every direction,
causing the torpedo boats to beat a precipitate and hasty retreat.
Fortunately the Turks were not possessed of any steamboats, nor were
any of their ships ready to dash out, or the defeat would have been a
far more disastrous one than was the case. Neither of the boats were
damaged, nor any of the crews injured.</p>

<p>The failure of this first attempt was due in a great measure to the
mode of attack, no system or unanimity of action on the part of the
four commanders being observable; and also to the somewhat half-hearted
support given to the <i>Tchesme</i>, for had her three consorts only
dashed at the Turkish ships as boldly, one at least of the Ottoman fleet
would have been sunk, the only defence resorted to being their guns
and small arms.</p>

<p>The moral effect of torpedoes was displayed here, causing the
<i>Constantine</i> to lay too far off the entrance to the harbour, thus
decreasing the chance of her boats making a successful attack.</p>

<p>The Russian version finishes up by saying, "although this first
endeavour was unsuccessful, the authors of it were received at Sebastopol
with enthusiasm."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">2nd Affair.</span></h3>

<p><i>The Matchin Attack.</i>&mdash;The second attempt was made on the 25th-26th
of May on two Turkish monitors, the <i>Fettu Islam</i> and the <i>Duba
Saife</i>, and a small river steamer, the <i>Kilidj Ali</i>, lying at anchor off
Matchin.<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>
<p>Four Russian torpedo boats were sent to the attack, viz. the
<i>Czarowitch</i>, Lieutenant Doubasoff; the <i>Xénie</i>, Lieutenant Chestakoff;
the <i>Djiquite</i>, Midshipman Persine; and the <i>Czarevna</i>, Midshipman
Bali. The total number of officers and men carried by these boats on
this occasion was forty-six.</p>

<p>The night of the attack was rainy, but not completely dark, since
the moon was above the horizon during nearly the whole of the
expedition.</p>

<p>The force left Brailoff at one o'clock on the morning of the 26th,
and advanced in two columns up the river, finding great difficulty
in stemming the strong current.</p>

<p>A boat from the <i>Duba Saife</i>, rowing guard some 500 yards in advance
of the squadron, observed the approach of the Russian boats, but allowed
them to pass on their voyage of destruction without attempting to stop
them, or alarm the vessels. On reaching within 150 yards of the <i>Duba
Saife</i>, Dubasoff in the <i>Czarowitch</i> was challenged, and failing to give
the correct answer was immediately fired at; but, nothing daunted by
the hail of shot and bullets, he dashed on, and succeeded in exploding
one of his spar torpedoes on the port side of the <i>Duba Saife</i>, just under
her quarter, a column of water and <i>débris</i> being thrown up to a height
of 120 feet, which partly filled his boat, but notwithstanding managed
to get safely away. The monitor not sinking as soon as expected,
Chestakoff in the <i>Xénie</i> dashed in, and completed the work of destruction,
the unfortunate ship sinking in a very few minutes after this last
explosion. The <i>Djiquite</i> was struck in the stern, and had to be run
ashore for repairs, but eventually all four boats reached Brailoff in
safety. The Russians allowed to neither killed nor wounded, which,
when the time they were exposed to the fire of the three Turkish ships
(about twenty minutes), the number of men (forty-six) engaged, and
their very close quarters, seems miraculous.</p>

<p>The <i>Duba Saife</i>, thus lost to the Turks, carried two 12 cm. Krupp
guns, and a crew of some sixty officers and men, few of whom were saved.
Lieutenants Dubasoff and Chestakoff were decorated with the 4th Class
of the Cross of Saint George, and three seamen received the insignia of
the Order of Military Merit.</p>

<p>This attack was conducted in a most gallant manner, and far more
systematically than the Batoum affair. If instead of holding one of
the boats in reserve, which was part of Dubasoff's plan, and the remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
three attacking one vessel, the force had divided itself into two
parties, and had made a simultaneous attack on both the monitors, the
probability is that the <i>Fettu Islam</i> would have shared the fate of her
consort.</p>

<p>The officer of the Turkish guard boat was tried by court-martial,
but what his ultimate fate was is not generally known. He certainly
deserved nothing less than death.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">3rd Affair.</span></h3>

<p><i>The Soulina Attack.</i>&mdash;The third attempt took place on the 9th-10th
of June, 1877, on a Turkish squadron lying at anchor off Soulina.<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a>
This squadron consisted of the three ironclads <i>Feteh Bulend</i>, <i>Moocardemikhair</i>,
and <i>Idglalieh</i>, and a tug, <i>Kartal</i>.</p>

<p>The Russian attacking force consisted of six torpedo boats, viz. the
No. 1, Lieutenant Poutschin; the No. 2, Lieutenant Rojdestvenski;
the <i>Tchesme</i>, Lieutenant Zatzarennyi; the <i>Sinope</i>, the <i>Navarino</i>,
and the <i>Soukoum Kalé</i>. The No. 2 was a specially constructed
torpedo boat, 68 feet long, and very fast. All were armed with spar
torpedoes, with the exception of the <i>Tchesme</i>, which carried a towing
torpedo. The boats were convoyed from Odessa by the <i>Constantine</i>,
some being carried, and some being towed; another steamer, the
<i>Vladimir</i>, supported her. The Turkish squadron were anchored in
quarter line, about one mile from the harbour; the <i>Kartal</i>, under
weigh, being used as an advance guard, and a few boats rowing guard
close to the ships being <i>the only means of protection</i> adopted by the
Turks. Passive obstructions, such as booms, nets, crinolines, &amp;c., were
not thought of, much less used.</p>

<p>On arriving about five miles from Soulina, the boats were formed
into two groups, the first consisting of the No. 1, the No. 2, and
the <i>Tchesme</i>, and despatched on their way. The working of their
engines was scarcely heard, and all lights were carefully hidden by
tarpaulins.</p>

<p>The first casualty that happened was the disabling of the
<i>Tchesme</i>, by the electric wire of her towing torpedo fouling the
screw, this obliging her to return to the <i>Constantine</i>. Aided by good
fortune, and by the darkness of the night, the No. 1 and the No. 2<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
succeeded in getting close to (30 yards) one of the Turkish vessels,
the <i>Idglalieh</i>, before being discovered, when they were at once hailed,
and, not answering, a tremendous fire of big guns and rifles was directed
on them from the <i>Idglalieh</i>, which was promptly followed by that
of the whole squadron, though from the other ships nothing of the
boats could be seen.</p>

<p>According to the Russians, the No. 2 succeeded in exploding her
torpedo close to, if not in contact with, a Turkish vessel, but from eyewitnesses
on board the squadron only one explosion was heard, viz.
that of Lieutenant Poutschin's torpedo. Any way, no damage whatever
was experienced by the Ottoman squadron. The No. 1 came down on
the <i>Idglalieh's</i> starboard bow, fouled her cable, and swung alongside,
exploding one of her torpedoes in so doing, but with no other result
than a wetting to those of the ironclad's crew, who were on the forecastle.
Alongside Poutschin remained for some minutes, but at last
managed to get clear, and then was either sunk by the <i>Idglalieh's</i> fire,
or, as he avers, on finding his screw foul, he sunk his boat, rather than
let her fall into the hands of the Turks. Poutschin and four of his
crew were picked up, after being some hours in the water, by the
squadron's boats.</p>

<p>The No. 2 seems to have suffered severely, her funnel being bent, the
axle of the steering wheel damaged, sixteen rivets were started, and the
iron keel plate had dropped some 18 inches, and finally the lower part
of her rudder broken, and one of the blades of her screw bent aft; part
of this damage was no doubt the effect of the explosion of her torpedo,
which was probably not in position, but unless she ran over some loose
stones of the Soulina breakwater, the damage to her keel and rudder
cannot be accounted for.</p>

<p>The second group of boats had followed up the first, but on hearing
the noise of the explosions and roar of the guns and rifles they
returned to the <i>Constantine</i>.</p>

<p>That ship, on observing the firing, endeavoured to close the land,
but she grounded, and remained until daylight in a difficult position,
but at last got afloat, and returned to Odessa with five out of her six
torpedo boats.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Rojdestvenski, the Commander of the No. 2, received
the 4th Class of the Cross of Saint George, and three seamen the
insignia of the Order of Military Merit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>On the part of the No. 1 and No. 2, this was a most gallant affair,
though unsuccessful, but as regards the remainder of the boats the
less said the better.</p>

<p>Had the Turkish squadron slipped the instant the alarm was given,
and steamed full speed in the direction of Odessa, the <i>Constantine</i> and
her convoy might have been cut off. Both the <i>Moorcademikhair</i> and
<i>Feteh Bulend</i> were 13 knot ships, and therefore considerably faster than
the enemy. But, as usual, the Turks were far too dilatory to take
advantage of the occasion.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">4th Affair.</span></h3>

<p><i>The Rustchuk Attack.</i>&mdash;The fourth torpedo attack was made on the
afternoon of the 20th of June, 1877, on a Turkish monitor off Rustchuk.</p>

<p>The only Russian torpedo boat sent to the attack on this occasion
was a Thornycroft named the <i>Choutka</i>, commanded by Lieutenant
Skrydloff, and accompanied by a celebrated Russian artist, Verechtckaguine
by name. The instant the torpedo boat was observed, so well
directed and steady a fire was kept up by the monitor that both the
lieutenant and the artist were badly wounded, and the electric wires
of the torpedo severed, thus obliging the <i>Choutka</i> to beat a retreat.
According to the Russian account, the monitor was struck by the boat's
torpedo spar, but the above seems the more likely version. This was
certainly a most audacious attack, and had the Turks only succeeded
in hitting the <i>Choutka</i> with her big gun, it would have ended fatally
for the Russians; as it was, the boat was struck by several bullets, but
none of the crew were wounded.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">5th Affair.</span></h3>

<p><i>The Aluta Attack.</i>&mdash;The fifth attack was made on the 30th of June,
1877, on a Turkish monitor off the mouth of the Aluta, in the river
Danube. This attempt, like the last, took place in broad daylight.
Four Russian boats were sent forward, but in spite of the captain of
the Turkish vessel doing all he could to run the boats down, none of
them succeeded in getting sufficiently near the vessel to enable a
torpedo to be placed in contact. The captain of the monitor took the
precaution to rig his lower booms out, and so managed to keep the
enemy's boats at a respectful distance, they imagining that mines were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
fixed to the ends of the booms. After two hours of this dodging
about, the Russians, finding the case hopeless, abandoned the attack.</p>

<p>The Russian account states&mdash;1st, that the captain of the monitor
was an Englishman; 2nd, that the vessel was protected by nets and
torpedoes lashed to the extremities of her booms&mdash;both of which statements
are radically wrong.</p>

<p>The torpedo boats forming the attack were the <i>Choutka</i>, Midshipman
Niloff, and the <i>Mina</i>, Sub-Lieutenant Arens, both armed with
the spar torpedo.</p>

<p>Unless indeed the Russians acted up to the old proverb which says
"Discretion is the best part of valour," it is difficult to understand how
four small easily handled boats could have been for one hour endeavouring
to strike a ship (which ship was at the same time being
man&oelig;uvred with a view of running them down) without either effecting
their object or being sunk or damaged in the attempt.</p>

<p>The Russians, though unsuccessful, behaved gallantly. Midshipman
Niloff was severely wounded, but no mention is made as to the number
of the crew that were killed and wounded, or of the damage received
by the boats. Niloff received the 4th Class of the Cross of St. George,
and Arens the Order of Military Merit.</p>

<p>The Turkish captain, Ali Bey, behaved most pluckily and skilfully.
The only wonder is that both the boats were not sunk by the monitor's
fire.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">6th Affair.</span></h3>

<p><i>The Soukoum Kaleh Attack.</i>&mdash;The sixth attempt was made on
the 23rd-24th of August, 1877, on a Turkish ironclad, the <i>Assari
Shefket</i>, at the time lying at anchor off Soukoum Kaleh.<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a> Four torpedo
boats composed the attacking force, viz. the <i>Sinope</i>, Lieutenant
Pisarefski; the <i>Torpedoist</i>, Midshipman Nelson Hirst; the <i>Navarino</i>,
Lieutenant Vichnevetski; and the <i>Tchesme</i>, Lieutenant Zatzarennyi, the
latter officer being in command. These boats had been brought to the
entrance of the harbour by the <i>Constantine</i>, and were despatched on
their mission of destruction about half past ten.</p>

<p>An eclipse of the moon occurred on this night, and, taking advantage
of this fact, the four Russian torpedo boats dashed into the
harbour at full speed and made for the Turkish vessel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>
<p>Fortunately for the safety of his ship and lives of his crew, the
captain of the Turkish ironclad had several boats rowing guard round
his ship, and otherwise everything on board in readiness for immediate
action. On the attacking flotilla nearing the guard boats, blue lights
were burnt, rifles fired, &amp;c., and the alarm given to those on the look-out
in the <i>Assari Shefket</i>. The moment the enemy were within range,
such a well-directed and heavy fire was poured on them that the attack
was completely foiled. One of the Russian torpedoes was exploded,
but failed to do more than throw a quantity of water up. The next
morning a pole with torpedo fixed on it was found by the Turks, and
on the strength of this and the numerous fragments of wood similarly
found, one if not more of the enemy's boats it was supposed must have
been sunk, or much knocked about.</p>

<p>This was a much better planned and executed attack, but was
unsuccessful owing to the extreme vigilance of the Turks.</p>

<p>This attempt will always be remembered by the Turks, on account
of the general order that appeared in the papers on the part of the
Russians, in which "the brilliant exploit and successful destruction
of the Turkish ironclad <i>Assari Shefket</i>" was set forth at great length;
she at the time that this appeared being quietly at anchor off the
dockyard at Stamboul, not having received any damage whatever.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">7th Affair.</span></h3>

<p><i>The Second Batoum Attack.</i>&mdash;The seventh attempt was made on the
night of the 27th-28th of December, 1877, on several Turkish men-of-war
anchored in the harbour of Batoum (the scene of the first Russian
torpedo attempt and failure). Four boats composed the attacking force,
viz. the <i>Tchesme</i>, Lieutenant Zatzarennyi, in command, armed with
a Whitehead fish torpedo, containing 32 kilog. of gun-cotton, fitted
to fire from a tube under the boat's keel; the <i>Sinope</i>, Lieutenant
Stchelinski, armed with a similarly charged fish torpedo, fitted to fire
from a raft, which was towed by the boat, and two other boats, armed
with spar and towing torpedoes.</p>

<p>The means employed at Batoum for the safeguard of the Ottoman
fleet there against such an attack was that of guard boats and a barrier
formed of logs of wood, with planks secured to them, so arranged by
means of weights that the planks remained perpendicular to the surface
of the water when in position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Owing to the extreme darkness of the night, the Russians managed
to evade the guard boats, and when, as they imagined, some 60 to
65 yards from a Turkish ironclad, the <i>Tchesme</i> and <i>Sinope's</i> Whitehead
fish torpedoes were started on their deadly mission; but, owing
most probably to the want of practice of manipulating these somewhat
delicate instruments, also to the darkness, and the slight swell there
was on at the time, both missed their mark, and were landed high and
dry on the beach astern of the ship.</p>

<p>One of these weapons was perfect, the other minus her fore compartment,
this having been knocked off by the torpedo colliding with
some hard object. No explosion was heard or seen by the Turks.</p>

<p>This was the second time that the fish torpedo had been employed
on actual service, and, as in the previous instance, failed.</p>

<p>The guard boats and barrier of the Turks seem to have been of
little avail.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">8th Affair.</span></h3>

<p><i>The Final Attack.</i>&mdash;The eighth and last attempt was made on the
night of the 25th-26th of January, 1878.</p>

<p>This was originally intended to be an attack on the Turkish fleet at
Batoum, but on entering that harbour the two Russian torpedo boats,
the <i>Tchesme</i>, Lieutenant Zatzarennyi, and the <i>Sinope</i>, Lieutenant
Stchelinski, were met by a Turkish revenue steamer, against which the
boats discharged their Whitehead torpedoes, resulting in her complete
destruction, at the same time arousing the squadron, and causing the
boats to beat a retreat.</p>

<p>Though the vessel destroyed was not a frigate, yet the expedition
was successful in so far as proving that it is possible to project Whitehead
fish torpedoes from boats at a distance of 70 to 90 yards from an
enemy's ship, on a dark night, and strike her with them.</p>

<p>This concludes the whole of the offensive torpedo operations that
were carried out during the war, of which two out of eight attempts
were successful, which is without doubt a fair percentage.</p>

<p>There seems every probability that the present struggle between
Chili and Peru, in the Pacific, will afford torpedoists further experience
of the various offensive torpedoes, when subjected to the test
of active service.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<small>ON EXPLOSIVES.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>EXPLOSION may be defined as the sudden or extremely rapid
conversion of a solid or liquid body of small bulk into gas or
vapour, occupying very many times the volume of the original substance,
and which in addition is highly expanded by the heat generated
during the action.</div>

<p>This sudden or very rapid expansion of volume is attended by an
exhibition of force which is more or less violent, according to the constitution
of the original body and the circumstances of the explosion.</p>

<p>Any substance capable of undergoing such a change on the
application of heat or other disturbing cause is called an "explosive."</p>

<p><i>Explosive Force.</i>&mdash;Explosive <i>force</i> is <i>directly</i> proportional to the
heat of combustion and the volume of gas, and <i>inversely</i> to the specific
heat of the mixed products.</p>

<p>Explosive <i>effect</i> is <i>directly</i> proportional to the volume of gas produced
and the temperature of the explosion, and <i>inversely</i> as the time
required for the change to take place.</p>

<p><i>Explosive Effect and Force compared.</i>&mdash;Explosive effect depends upon
the rapidity with which the conversion is effected, while the same
amount of explosive force may act suddenly or gradually.</p>

<p>As before stated, explosions are more or less violent according to
the <i>circumstances</i> under which they take place. These may be considered
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;The physical state of the explosive substance.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;The external conditions under which the explosive body is fired.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;The mode of firing.</div>

<p><i>The Physical State of the Explosive Substance.</i>&mdash;Numerous instances
may be cited to show the influence the physical condition of an
explosive body has upon its explosion.</p>

<p>Thus, gunpowder may, by merely varying the size, shape, and
density of the grain, be made to ignite rapidly but burn comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
slowly, or be made to ignite more slowly, but once inflamed to burn
very rapidly.</p>

<p>Again, gun-cotton in a loose, uncompressed state, will, if ignited,
only flash off; if it is spun into threads or woven into webs, its rate
of combustion may be so much reduced that it can be used in gunnery
or for a quick fuze; while if powerfully compressed and damp it burns
slowly. Wet gun-cotton requires a primer of dry gun-cotton and a
fulminate fuze to explode; dry, it may be exploded by a fulminate
fuze, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Then nitro-glycerine, when exploded by 15 grains of fulminate
of mercury, and at a temperature above 40° F., is very violently
detonated; below 40° F. it freezes and cannot be similarly exploded.</p>

<p>To obtain the full effect of all explosives, confinement is absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>The more rapid the explosion the less confinement required,
approaching in the case of some explosives to so small an amount that
it need not, for practical purposes, be considered.</p>

<p>Thus a charge of nitro-glycerine or gun-cotton, when detonated in
the open air, will destroy wrought iron rails, large blocks of stones,
balks of timber, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the case of the former body, the confinement of the atmosphere
is sufficient.</p>

<p>In the latter, the mechanical cohesion due to compression is sufficient
restraint.</p>

<p>Abel states that if the film of atmosphere surrounding the nitro-glycerine,
not exceeding 1/1000 inch in thickness, be removed, the
explosive effect is much lessened.</p>

<p>A large charge of gunpowder fired in the ordinary way under water
requires a strong case to retain the gases until the action has become
general, or, owing to its slow rate of burning, the case would be
broken before the whole of the charge had been ignited, and part of
the charge drowned.</p>

<p>This is often to be noticed when firing fine-grained powder in
heavy guns.</p>

<p>Igniting the charge at several points diminishes the confinement
needed.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Firing.</i>&mdash;The application of heat, directly or indirectly, is
the principal means of causing an explosion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>The flame from a percussion cap or primer, or a platinum wire
heated to incandescence by an electric current, will <i>directly</i> ignite a
charge. Friction, concussion, &amp;c., will <i>indirectly</i> ignite a charge due
to the conversion of mechanical energy into heat.</p>

<p>It would appear that when one explosive body is used as a means
of firing another, the resultant explosion is due to the blow suddenly
formed by the gas of the firing charge acting percussively upon the
mass to be exploded. If such were the case, then the most powerful
explosive would be the best agent for causing an explosion. But it is
not so.</p>

<p>For example, nitro-glycerine, which is far more powerful than
fulminate of mercury, requires more than 1000 grains to explode gun-cotton,
while only 15 grains of the latter is needful for the same
work, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A small quantity of an explosive substance which is sensitive to
friction or percussion is often used to ignite the original charge.</p>

<p><i>Detonation.</i>&mdash;The instantaneous explosion of the whole mass of a
body is defined as "detonation."</p>

<p>The essential difference between an explosion and a detonation is
the comparative suddenness of the transformation of the solid or liquid
explosive substance into gas and vapour.</p>

<p>Some explosive bodies, such as the fulminates, &amp;c., always detonate,
while the detonation of others depends on the mode of firing.</p>

<p>Nitro-glycerine always explodes violently, but when fired with an
initiatory charge of fulminate of mercury it is much more powerful
than when fired with gunpowder.</p>

<p>Compressed gun-cotton in the air-dry state can be detonated by
2 grains of fulminate of mercury embedded in the material, but when
it contains 3 per cent. of water over and above the 2 per cent. which
exists normally in the air-dry substance, 15 grains of the fulminate
will not always do so.</p>

<p><i>Theory of Detonation.</i>&mdash;The theory of detonation is not yet
thoroughly understood. That it is not alone due to the heat caused
by the impact of the mechanical energy of the particles of gas, set free
from the initiatory charge on the principal mass, is proved by the fact
of its being possible to detonate wet gun-cotton.</p>

<p>Professor Bloxam terms detonation to be "sympathetic" explosion.</p>

<p>Experiments carried on in England by Professor Abel, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
France by MM. Champion and Pellet, tend to show that it is due to
the vibratory action of the detonating agent.</p>

<p>Thus a glass may withstand a strong blow, though a particular note
or vibration will smash it.</p>

<p>All explosive compounds and mixtures, including gunpowder, are
susceptible of violent explosion through the agency of a detonation.</p>

<p><i>Roux and Sarrau.</i>&mdash;Roux and Sarrau divide explosions into two
orders:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1st order.&mdash;Detonations.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2nd order.&mdash;Simple explosions.</div>

<p>Simple explosions are produced by direct inflammation, or by a
small charge of gunpowder.</p>

<p>Detonations are obtained from nitro-glycerine, gun-cotton, &amp;c., by
exploding with fulminate of mercury.</p>

<p>They state that fulminate of mercury does not detonate gunpowder;
but if the exploding charge is a small amount of nitro-glycerine, itself
detonated by fulminate of mercury, then an explosion of the first order
is obtained.</p>

<p>The relative effects were approximately measured by determining
the quantities necessary to rupture small cast iron shells of supposed
equal strength.</p>

<p><i>Results of their Experiments.</i>&mdash;The following are some of the
results:&mdash;</p>

<p>According to the above table, nitro-glycerine is more than ten
times, and gun-cotton more than six times, as powerful as gunpowder
fired in the ordinary way (2nd order).</p>

<p>The want of reciprocity between two detonating agents is shown in
a remarkable degree by the following experiments, carried out by
Professor Abel:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;The detonation of 1/4 ounce of gun-cotton (the smallest quantity
that can be thus applied) induced the simultaneous detonation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of nitro-glycerine, enclosed in a vessel of sheet tin,
and placed at a distance of 1 inch from the gun-cotton.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;The detonation of 1/2 ounce of gun-cotton produces the same effect
with an intervening space of 3 inches between the substances.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;The detonation of 2 ounces of nitro-glycerine in <i>close contact</i>
with compressed gun-cotton failed to accomplish the
detonation of the latter, which was simply dispersed in
a fine state of division, in all the instances but one, in a
large number of experiments.</div>

<p>Explosive agents are divided into explosive mixtures and
compounds.</p>

<p>In the former the ingredients are mechanically mixed, and can be
separated by mechanical means.</p>

<p>In the latter the ingredients are chemically combined, and can
only be separated by chemical change.</p>

<p><i>Torpedo Explosive Agents.</i>&mdash;The explosive agents that are practically
the most important, as far as their employment as torpedo charges are
concerned, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<li>2.&mdash;Dynamite (No. 1).</li>
<li>3.&mdash;Gun-cotton.</li>
<li>4.&mdash;Fulminate of mercury.</li>
</ul>


<h3>A.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Explosive Mixtures.</span></h3>

<p><i>Gunpowder.</i>&mdash;This explosive mixture is composed of seventy-five parts
of nitre (saltpetre), fifteen parts of charcoal, and ten parts of sulphur.</p>

<p>On being ignited, the oxygen which is feebly held by the nitrogen
combines with the carbon, forming carbonic oxide gas, whilst the
sulphur unites with the potassium of the nitre, the whole combination
being accompanied by a great evolution of heat and expansion of gas,
and the nitrogen is set free.</p>

<p><i>Properties, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;A spark, friction between hard bodies, or a temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of 572° F., are any of them sufficient to cause an explosion of
gunpowder.</p>

<p>Slight moisture, due to damp air, &amp;c., produces caking and
deterioration.</p>

<p>Wetting causes permanent destruction.</p>

<p>Frost does not injure it.</p>

<p>It can be fired by ordinary methods.</p>

<p>It can be transported and handled with safety and great ease.</p>

<p>It is not a suitable explosive agent for torpedoes, on account of its
liability to be injured by damp, as well as its not being sufficiently
violent, though for the sake of convenience, &amp;c., it is often employed
for such work.</p>

<p>The effect produced by the explosion of a charge of gunpowder,
ignited by the ordinary method, is that of an uplifting rather than a
shattering effect.</p>

<p>This evil may be greatly remedied, when gunpowder is used as
the charge of a torpedo, by firing it with a detonator, by which means
its fullest explosive effect is developed.</p>

<p><i>Picric Powder.</i>&mdash;The picrates are salts of picric acid.</p>

<p>Picric acid is formed by the action of nitric acid on carbolic acid.</p>

<p>The picrate employed by Professor Abel is prepared from picric
acid and ammonium. This preparation, or salt mixed with nitre
(saltpetre), forms Abel's picric powder.</p>

<p><i>Properties, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;It is prepared for use in a similar manner to
gunpowder, and it can be handled in the same way.</p>

<p>It is less violent than dynamite or gun-cotton, though much
more so than gunpowder.</p>

<p>It is difficult to explode it by blows or friction.</p>

<p>If flame be applied to it, the part touched burns, but the combustion
does not become general.</p>

<p>This explosive agent will probably be used for spar torpedoes, when
gun-cotton or dynamite are not employed.</p>


<h3>B.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Explosive Compounds.</span></h3>

<p><i>Nitro-glycerine.</i>&mdash;Nitro-glycerine is formed by the action of nitric
acid upon glycerine at a low temperature.</p>

<p>The manufacture of this compound consists, first, in the slow mixture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of the glycerine with the acid, at a low temperature; secondly, in
washing the nitro-glycerine from the excess of acid with water.</p>

<p>The nitric acid before use is mixed with a certain proportion of
strong sulphuric acid, so that the water formed during the reaction
may be taken up, and thus any dilution of the nitric acid is prevented.</p>

<p>Nitro-glycerine is composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and
oxygen, as indicated by the equation <i>C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub></i>.</p>

<p><i>Properties, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;At ordinary temperatures nitro-glycerine is an
oily liquid, having a specific gravity of 1·6. Freshly made it is creamy
white and opaque, but clears and becomes colourless on standing
for a certain time, depending on the temperature.</p>

<p>It does not mix with, nor is it affected by, water. It has a sweet,
aromatic taste, and produces a violent headache if placed upon the
tongue.</p>

<p>The opaque, freshly made nitro-glycerine does not freeze until the
temperature is lowered to 3°-5° below zero, F., but, when cleared, it
freezes at 39°-40° F. Nitro-glycerine freezes to a white crystalline
mass, and in this state it can be thawed by placing the vessel containing
it in water, at a temperature not over 100° F.</p>

<p>If flame is applied to freely exposed nitro-glycerine, it burns slowly
without explosion.</p>

<p>Nitro-glycerine in a state of decomposition becomes very sensitive,
exploding violently when struck, even when unconfined.</p>

<p>Pure nitro-glycerine does not spontaneously decompose at any
ordinary temperature, but if it contains any free acid, then decomposition
may happen. When pure, it is not sensitive to friction, or
moderate percussion. If struck with a hammer, only the particle
receiving the blow explodes, the remainder being scattered.</p>

<p>The firing point of nitro-glycerine is about 356° F., though it begins
to decompose at a lower temperature.</p>

<p>The mode of firing nitro-glycerine usually employed is that of a
fulminate of mercury detonating fuse.</p>

<p>Nitro-glycerine in the frozen state cannot be fired even by large
charges of fulminate.</p>

<p>In one instance, 1600 lbs. of liquid nitro-glycerine exploded in a
magazine containing 600 lbs. of the same substance in a frozen state,
but failed to fire the latter, only breaking it up and scattering it in
every direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dynamite.</i>&mdash;This explosive compound is merely a preparation in
which nitro-glycerine is itself presented for use, its explosive properties
being those of the nitro-glycerine contained in it, as the
absorbent is an inert body.</p>

<p>Dynamite is formed of seventy-five parts of nitro-glycerine absorbed
by twenty-five parts of a porous siliceous earth or "kieselguhr."</p>

<p>The best substitute for "kieselguhr" is ashes of bog-head coal.</p>

<p>Dynamite is a loose, soft, readily moulded substance, of a buff colour.</p>

<p>The preparation of dynamite is very simple.</p>

<p>The nitro-glycerine is mixed by means of wooden spatulas with the
fine white powder (kieselguhr) in a leaden vessel.</p>

<p>It freezes at 39°-40° F., and when solidly frozen cannot be exploded,
but if in a pulverised state it can be exploded, though with diminished
violence.</p>

<p>It can be easily thawed, by placing the vessel containing it in hot
water.</p>

<p>Friction or moderate percussion does not explode it.</p>

<p>Its firing point is 356° F.</p>

<p>If flame be applied to it, it burns with a strong flame.</p>

<p>It is fired by means of fulminate of mercury, and its explosive force
is about seven times that of gunpowder.</p>

<p>For ground and buoyant mines, where actual contact between the
hostile vessel and the torpedo will be rarely achieved, this being
next to nitro-glycerine the most violent of all known explosive agents,
and being cheaply and readily procured, is the very best explosive
for such torpedoes.</p>

<p>That it is not generally adopted is owing to its containing a large
proportion of that seemingly dangerous substance, nitro-glycerine,
which makes the handling of dynamite a somewhat hazardous operation.</p>

<p>According to Professor Abel, there are now as many as fifteen
dynamite factories in different parts of the world (including a very
extensive one in Scotland) working under the supervision of Mr. Nobel,
the originator of the nitro-glycerine industry; and six or seven other
establishments exist where dynamite or preparations of very similar
character are also manufactured.</p>

<p>The total production of dynamite in 1867 was only eleven tons,
while in 1878 it amounted to 6140 tons.</p>

<p>This explosive compound is most extensively used for general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
blasting purposes all over the world, and for this purpose, owing to its
cheapness and the convenience in manipulating it, is far superior to
compressed gun-cotton.</p>

<p>Gun-cotton is formed by the action of concentrated nitric acid on
cotton, its composition being indicated by the formula <i>CH<sub>7</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Professor Abel's process for manufacturing pulped and compressed
gun-cotton is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Cotton waste is the form of cotton used; it is picked and cleaned,
thoroughly dried at 160° F., and then allowed to cool.</p>

<p>The strongest nitric and sulphuric acids are employed, mixed in
the proportion of one part of the former to three of the latter by
weight. These are mixed in large quantities, and stored in cast-iron
tanks.</p>

<p>The cotton in 1-lb. charges is immersed in the acid mixture,
which is contained in a trough surrounded by cold water. After being
subjected to the action of the acid for a short space of time, the cotton
is taken up, placed upon a perforated shelf, and as much as possible
of the acid squeezed out of it. It is then put into jars, covered with
fresh acid, and the jars placed in fresh water, remaining there for
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>To remove the acid, the gun-cotton from the jars is thrown into a
centrifugal strainer, by which nearly all the acid is expelled. It is
then diffused quickly in small quantities through a large volume of
water, and again passed through a centrifugal machine.</p>

<p>The next process is that of thoroughly washing the gun-cotton, for
the purpose of removing the traces of the acid still adhering to it. By
pulping, which operation is performed in pulping engines or beaters,
the washing is expeditious and thorough.</p>

<p>A <i>beater</i> is an oblong tub in which is placed a revolving wheel
carrying strips of steel on its circumference. From the bottom under
the wheel project similar steel strips.</p>

<p>The action of this machine is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>By the rotation of the wheel, the gun-cotton which is suspended in
water circulates around the tub, and is drawn between the two sets of
steel projections, by which it is reduced to a state of <i>pulp</i>.</p>

<p>The bottom of the tub is movable, and thus the space through
which the gun-cotton must pass may be contracted, as the operation
proceeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>The pulping being complete, the contents are run into <i>poachers</i> for
the final washing.</p>

<p>A <i>poacher</i> is a large oblong wooden tub. On one side at the
middle is placed a wooden paddle-wheel, which extends half way across
the tub.</p>

<p>In the poacher the pulped gun-cotton is stirred for a long time with
a large quantity of water. The revolution of the paddle-wheel keeps
up a constant circulation, and care is taken that no deposit occurs in
any part of the tub.</p>

<p>Having converted the cotton into gun-cotton, reduced it to a state
of pulp, and thoroughly washed it, the next process is to separate the
water from the pulp, and compress it into cakes or discs.</p>

<p>This is accomplished by means of two presses, the first of which
has 36 hollow cylinders, in which perforated plungers work upwards.</p>

<p>These plungers having been drawn down, the cylinders are filled
with the water-laden pulp, and their tops covered with a weight; the
plungers are then forced up by hydraulic power, compressing the pulp,
and forcing the water to escape through their perforations.</p>

<p>The second one is used to more solidly compress the cylindrical
masses of gun-cotton formed by the action of the first press, a pressure
of 6 tons to the inch being in this case applied.</p>

<p>About 6 per cent. of moisture still remains in the discs, which can
be readily removed by drying.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i>&mdash;Cotton converted into gun-cotton is little changed in
appearance, though the latter is harsher to the touch than the former.</p>

<p>If a flame be applied to dry loose gun-cotton, it flashes up, without
explosion; if compressed it burns rapidly, but quietly.</p>

<p>Moist compressed gun-cotton under the same circumstances burns
away slowly.</p>

<p>Gun-cotton containing 12 to 14 per cent. of water is ignited with
much difficulty on applying a highly heated body. As it leaves the
hydraulic press upon being converted from the pulped state to masses,
it contains about 15 per cent. of water; in this condition it may be
thrown on to a fire or held in a flame without exhibiting any tendency
to burn; the masses may be perforated by means of a red-hot iron, or
with a drilling tool, and they may with perfect safety be cut into slices
by means of saws revolving with great rapidity. If placed upon a fire
and allowed to remain there, a feeble and transparent flame flickers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
over the surface of the wet gun-cotton from time to time as the exterior
becomes sufficiently dry to inflame; in this way a piece of compressed
gun-cotton will burn away very gradually indeed.</p>

<p>To test the safety of wet gun-cotton, the following two experiments
among many have been made:&mdash;</p>

<p>Quantities of wet gun-cotton, 20 cwt. each, packed in one instance
in a large, strong wooden case, and in the other in a number of strong
packing cases, were placed in small magazines, very substantially built
of concrete and brickwork. Large fires were kindled around the
packages in each building, the doors being just left ajar. The entire
contents of both buildings had burned away, without anything approaching
explosive action, in less than two hours.</p>

<p>This comparatively great safety of wet gun-cotton, coupled with
the fact that its detonation in that state may be readily accomplished
through the agency of a small quantity of dry gun-cotton, termed a
"primer," which, by means of a fulminating fuze, or detonator, is
made to act as the initiative detonating agent, gives it important advantages
over other violent explosive agents, when used for purposes
which involve the employment of a considerable quantity of the
material, on account of the safety attending its storage and necessary
manipulation.</p>

<p>From experiments conducted by engineer officers in Austria, it
was found that if boxes containing dry compressed gun-cotton are
fired into from small arms, even at a short range, the gun-cotton
is generally inflamed, but never exploded, the sharpness of the
blow essential to effect an explosion, which the bullet might otherwise
give, being diminished by its penetration through the side of
the box before reaching the explosive. Wet gun-cotton, containing
even as little as 15 per cent. of water, is never inflamed on these
conditions.</p>

<p>Dynamite, on the other hand, is invariably detonated when struck
by a bullet on passing through the side of the box.</p>

<p>Gun-cotton is insoluble in and unaffected by water.</p>

<p>The firing point of gun-cotton is about 360° F.</p>

<p>The temperature of explosion of gun-cotton is about 8700° F.,
being more than double that of gunpowder. Gun-cotton is not
sensitive to friction or percussion.</p>

<p>If not perfectly converted or thoroughly washed, gun-cotton is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
liable to spontaneous decomposition, which under favourable conditions
may result in explosion.</p>

<p>Compressed gun-cotton is free from such danger, as it may be kept
and used saturated with water. It is stored in the wet state, care
being taken that it is not exposed to a temperature that will freeze
the water in the cakes, as if this occurs they are liable to be disintegrated
by the expansion of the water in freezing.</p>

<p>Gun-cotton is the agent most extensively used for all kinds of
military engineering and submarine operations in Great Britain, it being
especially manufactured by the English government for that express
purpose; but in other countries it is not so manufactured, and therefore,
as it is little used for other than military purposes, it is not to
any extent privately manufactured, as is the case with other explosives,
such as dynamite, dualine, lithofracteur, &amp;c., and thus, in case of war,
would be somewhat difficult to obtain out of England.</p>

<p>Compared with dynamite, it is not so violent, and occupies more
space, weight for weight, and also requires a more complicated means
of detonating it. On the other hand, gun-cotton is infinitely safer to
store and manipulate, and is not so subject to detonation by concussion
(not being so sensitive) as dynamite.</p>

<p><i>Fulminate of Mercury.</i>&mdash;Fulminate of mercury is formed by the
action of mercuric nitrate and nitric acid upon alcohol. The mode
of preparation is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Dissolve one part of mercury in twelve parts of nitric acid, and
pour this solution into twelve parts of alcohol.</p>

<p>Pour this mixture into a vessel which is placed in hot water until
it darkens and becomes turbid and begins to evolve dense white
fumes, then remove it from the water. The reaction goes on, with
strong effervescence and copious evolution of dense white ethereal
vapours. If red fumes appear, cold alcohol should be added to check
the violence of the action.</p>

<p>The operation should be performed at a distance from a fire or
flame, and in a strong draught, so that the vapours may be carried off.</p>

<p>When the liquid clears, and the dense white fumes are no longer
given off, further action is stopped by filling up with cold water.
The fulminate settles to the bottom of the vessel as a grey crystalline
precipitate. The liquid is then poured off, and the fulminate washed
several times by decantation or upon a filter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Dry fulminate of mercury explodes violently when heated to 367°
F., when forcibly struck by the electric spark, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When wet it is inexplosive, and therefore it is always kept wet,
being dried in small amounts when required for use.</p>

<p>Fulminate of mercury is applied in many ways, either pure or
mixed with other substances, as in percussion caps, percussion powder,
primers, detonators, &amp;c.</p>

<p>For the purpose of detonating nitro-glycerine or its preparations,
15 grains of the fulminate are sufficient, but to detonate gun-cotton
25 grains are necessary. The fulminate in detonating fuzes should
be enclosed in a copper case or cap, and must never be loose. The
fulminate should be wet when charging the detonators, as it is very
dangerous to handle when dry.</p>

<p>Great care is requisite in handling this explosive compound.</p>

<p>In addition to the foregoing explosive compounds and mixtures,
the following explosive agents have also been employed for the
purposes of submarine operations, though only to a small extent.</p>

<p><i>Dualin.</i>&mdash;Dualin is a nitro-glycerine preparation formed by mixing
sawdust and saltpetre with that substance.</p>

<p>This preparation, inferior to dynamite, was employed by the
Germans as the explosive agent for their submarine mines during the
Franco-German war (1870-71).</p>

<p><i>Lithofracteur.</i>&mdash;Lithofracteur is also a preparation of nitro-glycerine.
It is composed of the following materials:&mdash;Nitro-glycerine, kieselguhr,
coal, soda, saltpetre, and sulphur.</p>

<p>This explosive agent, also inferior to dynamite, is used, though
not very extensively, by the French for their submarine mines.</p>

<p><i>Horsley's Powder.</i>&mdash;Horsley's powder is a chlorate mixture formed
of potassium, chlorate, and galls. This explosive mixture was formerly
used by Captain Harvey for his towing torpedo, but has recently been
discarded for compressed gun-cotton.</p>

<p><i>Abel's Detonation Experiments.</i>&mdash;The following are the results of
experiments carried out by Professor Abel, C.B., F.R.S., on the
subject of detonation:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;A fuze containing rather more than 1 ounce of gunpowder,
strongly confined, exploded in contact with a mass of compressed
gun-cotton, <i>only inflames it</i>, although the explosion
of the fuze is apparently a sharp one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;45 grains of fulminate of mercury, exploded unconfined on the
surface of a piece of compressed gun-cotton, only inflames
or disperses it.</div>

<div class='hang2'>3.&mdash;A fuze containing 9 grains of fulminate of mercury, strongly
confined, exploded in contact with compressed gun-cotton,
or dynamite, detonates it with certainty.</div>

<div class='hang2'>4.&mdash;An equal quantity of fulminate of mercury, similarly confined,
does not detonate <i>uncompressed</i> gun-cotton in which it is
imbedded, but merely disperses and inflames it.</div>

<div class='hang2'>5.&mdash;150 grains of compressed gun-cotton, detonated in proximity
to dynamite, <i>detonates the latter</i>.</div>

<div class='hang2'>6.&mdash;3 ounces of dynamite, and very much larger quantities, detonated
in contact with compressed gun-cotton, only
disperses it.</div>

<div class='hang2'>7.&mdash;A wrought-iron rail can be destroyed by detonating 8 ounces
of compressed gun-cotton placed unconfined on the rail.</div>

<div class='hang2'>8.&mdash;A piece of wet gun-cotton, quite uninflammable, removed from
a fire, and detonated upon a block of granite, using a small
primer of dry gun-cotton, shatters the block.</div>

<div class='hang2'>9.&mdash;A submerged charge of wet gun-cotton, open on all sides to the
water, and merely confined around the dry initiative, or
primer, by means of a net, can be exploded.</div>

<p><i>Explosive Agents in Torpedoes.</i>&mdash;The explosive agents that at the
present time are most generally used in torpedoes are gunpowder,
gun-cotton in the wet compressed state, and dynamite, and these may
be compared as to their properties and their explosive effects.</p>

<p><i>Gunpowder.</i>&mdash;Gunpowder is a familiar material, in general use for
all military purposes. It can be handled and transported with safety
and ease, and it can be fired by ordinary methods. But for submarine
purposes it has the disadvantage of being very easily injured by
water, so that it is absolutely necessary to enclose it in water-tight
cases.</p>

<p><i>Gun-cotton.</i>&mdash;Gun-cotton is free from liability to accidents, and in
this matter, and the safety of its manufacture, it compares favourably
with gunpowder.</p>

<p>It is peculiarly adapted to submarine work, being unaffected by
water. And as it may be kept in water, ready for use, it can be safely
carried on board ship in large quantities. It is far more violent in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
action when detonated than gunpowder. The chief objection to its
use is, that being applied only for special purposes, it is not readily
obtained. Also it requires a peculiar and somewhat complicated
mode of firing it.</p>

<p><i>Dynamite.</i>&mdash;Dynamite is more easily manufactured than the two
foregoing explosives. The fact of it containing nitro-glycerine, which
has a bad reputation, has militated against its use as a torpedo explosive
agent, though for blasting purposes it is most extensively used.
Though not directly affected by water, its firing is hindered when
diffused through water. Another disadvantage is its high freezing
point. Like gun-cotton, it requires special means to fire it, though
much simpler, and also is much more powerful than gunpowder. The
explosive effect of dynamite or gun-cotton is a rending or a shattering
one, while that of gunpowder is an uplifting or heaving one.</p>

<p>Again, it is necessary when using gunpowder that the object be in
the line of least resistance, but with dynamite or gun-cotton the effect
is nearly equal in every direction, therefore for submarine operations,
either dynamite or gun-cotton is the explosive agent that should be
invariably used.</p>

<p><i>Size of Torpedo Charges.</i>&mdash;For permanent mines, a charge of
700 lbs. to 1000 lbs. of gun-cotton is quite sufficient, though too
large a charge cannot be employed, except as regards the matter of
convenience.</p>

<p>For buoyant mines, 500 lbs. to 700 lbs. of gun-cotton is an ample
charge, and for contact mines, 200 lbs. to 300 lbs. of gun-cotton is
sufficient. In spar torpedoes, where lightness is a consideration, gun-cotton
charges of 30 lbs. to 50 lbs. will be found ample, and similarly in
the case of the towing or locomotive torpedoes. Of course, with regard
to such a submarine weapon as the Lay torpedo boat, any size charge
may be carried, according to the wish of the builder.</p>

<p><i>Torpedo Explosions illustrated.</i>&mdash;At <a href="#Fig_166">Fig. 166</a> is represented a sketch
of a torpedo explosion, from a photograph taken at the moment the
column of water was at its greatest elevation. The torpedo contained
432 lbs. of gun-cotton, and was exploded under 27 feet of water.</p>

<p>The height of the column thrown up measured 81 feet, and the
diameter at the base 132 feet.</p>

mine, but at a depth of 41 feet below the surface. Its extreme height
was 400 feet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<small>TORPEDO EXPERIMENTS.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE following are some of the more important torpedo experiments
that have been carried out in England and Europe, to investigate
the subject of submarine explosions as applied to ships and to mines,
&amp;c., these experiments extending over a space of thirteen years.</div>

<p><i>Experiment at Chatham, England, 1865.</i>&mdash;This experiment was
carried out to ascertain the effect of gunpowder torpedoes on the
bottom of a wooden ship.</p>

<p>Target:&mdash;H.M.S. <i>Terpsichore</i>, a wooden sloop of war.</p>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;150 lbs. of fine-grained powder. Two were used. They
were placed on the ground, about 13' below the ship's keel, and 2'
horizontally clear of her side.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;A hole of about 4' radius was made, about 19'
nearly vertical from the charge; the <i>Terpsichore</i> sinking a few minutes
after the explosion.</p>

<p><i>Experiment in Austria.</i>&mdash;The object of this experiment was to
ascertain the effect of a very large charge of gun-cotton exploded at
some distance from the side of a wooden vessel.</p>

<p>Target:&mdash;A wooden sloop.</p>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;400 lbs. of gun-cotton, placed 10' below the surface of the
water, and 24' horizontally from the bottom of the vessel.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Complete destruction of the vessel.</p>

<p><i>Experiments at Carlscrona, Sweden, 1868.</i>&mdash;These experiments were
made to investigate the effect of submarine contact mines, charged with
dynamite, against a strong wooden vessel, as well as against a double-bottomed
iron vessel. They were carried out under the supervision of
Lieut.-Colonel Zethations, of the Royal Swedish Navy.</p>

<p>Target:&mdash;The hull of a 60 gun frigate, which had been built in
1844; it had been cut down to the battery deck, and the copper
removed. Her timbers and planking were quite sound; timbers of oak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
about 13" square, and 1" apart; planking of Swedish pine, 5-1/2"; bottom
strengthened inside with wrought-iron diagonal bands, 6" by 1-1/4";
inside planking running half way up to the battery deck of oak; 6"
thick. This completes the wooden target.</p>

<p>On the port side a quadrangular opening was made, and fitted
with a construction representing a strong double iron bottom, firmly
fastened to an oaken frame that had been put on inside, on the four
sides of the opening, and with through-going bolts, 1" in diameter, to
the timbers.</p>

<p>Torpedoes:&mdash;No. 1.&mdash;13 lbs. dynamite, enclosed in 1/12" iron case.
It was placed on the starboard side, amidships, 7' below the water line,
and 2' 2" from the bottom of the ship.</p>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;16 lbs. dynamite, enclosed in a glass vessel. It was placed
on the starboard side, 7-3/4' below the water line, 3' from the bottom of
the ship, and 40' from her stern.</p>

<p>No. 3.&mdash;16 lbs. dynamite, enclosed in 1/12" iron case. It was placed
on the port side, 5-3/4' below the water line, 2' from the bottom of the ship,
and 30' from her stern.</p>

<p>No. 4.&mdash;10 lbs. dynamite, in a case as above. It was placed on the
port side, 6-1/2' below the water line, 2-1/6' from the bottom of the ship, and
70' from her stern.</p>

<p>No. 5.&mdash;13 lbs. dynamite, in case as above. It was placed 7-1/3' below
the water line, 2-1/6' from the centre of the <i>iron</i> bottom.</p>

<p>These five torpedoes were fired at the same moment.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;The hull of the ship was lifted about a foot,
and sunk in 1-1/2 minutes.</p>

<p>No. 1 Mine.&mdash;Timbers broken and thrown inside, into the hold, on
a space of about 15' × 8'; three more timbers on one side of this hole
broken; inside oak planking rent off on a length of 14'; two iron bands
torn up and bent, one of them broken in two places; outside planking
torn off on a space of 21' × 12'; several planks still higher up
broken.</p>

<p>No. 2 Mine.&mdash;Timbers blown away on a space of about 8' square;
inside planking torn off on a length of 20'; two iron bands broken, and
torn up and bent; and outside planking rent off on a space of
19' × 12'.</p>

<p>No. 3 Mine.&mdash;Timbers blown away on a space of 10-1/2' × 12' at one
end, and 6' at the other; inside planking off for a length of 14'; one iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
band torn up, and one broken; outside planking off on a space of
18' × 25' × 15'.</p>

<p>No. 4 Mine.&mdash;Timbers blown away on a space 4' × 16'; on the
sides of this hole, ten timbers were broken; two iron bands torn
up, and one broken; inside planking off for a length of 20'; outside
planking off for a space of 20' × 23' × 10', and 13 feet.</p>

<p>No. 5 Mine.&mdash;The gas sphere of this mine had hit the middle of the
outside plates on one of the angle-iron ribs. This rib was torn from
the timbers and bent up, nearly 2' in the middle, but not broken.
There was an oval hole in the outside plates 4' × 3' between two ribs,
which ribs, with the plates on edge riveted to them, were bulged out
about 5 inches. The inner plate, one large piece was blown up in a
vertical position, after having cut all the bolts and rivets, sixty of 1",
and thirty of 3/4", save those that fastened the lower side to the oaken
frame and timbers. On a length of 30' and height of 20', the bottom,
on all sides of the iron construction, had been bent inwards; the greatest
bend was about 5"; three deck beams above had been broken.</p>

<p>By the joint effect of all the mines, almost all the iron deck beam
knees had been rent from the side, and there was an opening between
deck and hull on both sides for a length of about 130 feet.</p>

<p><i>Experiment at Kiel.</i>&mdash;Target:&mdash;A large gun-boat, greatly strengthened
internally by solid balks of timber.</p>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;200 lbs. gunpowder. It was placed nearly under her
keel, at a distance of 15 feet.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Complete destruction of the vessel.</p>

<p><i>Experiment in England, 1874.</i>&mdash;Target:&mdash;A rectangular iron case
20' long, 10' high, and 8' wide, divided into six compartments by
means of one longitudinal bulkhead midway between the front and
rear faces of the target, and two athwartship bulkheads equidistant
from the ends of the target. Thickness of front and rear faces 11/16", of
longitudinal bulkhead 1/4", of athwartship bulkheads 3/8".</p>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;100 lbs. of gunpowder, enclosed in a spar torpedo case
and fired by two detonators. It was exploded in contact with the
target, 7-1/2' below the surface of the water, and 7' from top of target.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion on the target:&mdash;"Front of centre compartment
destroyed and top blown off. Plate representing inner skin destroyed.
Back of centre compartment (rear face of the target) much bulged, and
penetrated; the hole measured 36' × 15". Large portions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
target were thrown to a height of 150 to 200 feet, and from 80 to 100
yards' distance."</p>

<p>The effect of explosion on a ship's pinnace, which had been placed
16 feet from and at right angles to the front face of the target, with
steam up, and canopy and shield in position, was that a large quantity
of water was thrown back in the boat, putting the fires out, and filling
the boat up to her thwarts, but otherwise the boat was uninjured.</p>

<p><i>Experiments at Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1874.</i>&mdash;The object of these
experiments was to ascertain if a ship's armoured side would be
seriously injured by a torpedo exploded in contact with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">1st Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Target:&mdash;1" thick, and 2' × 2', supported in a horizontal position
on a substructure consisting of 8" timber resting on two pieces of 6"
timber under two sides, and completely supported by earth up to lower
edge of substructure.</p>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;33 lbs. of dynamite, enclosed in a square wooden case
2-1/4" high, and 5·5" × 5·5"; it was placed on the middle of the earth
with 8" of earth tamping; this tamping representing the resistance
of a thin stratum of water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;The plate was broken into four pieces, and
substructure crushed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">2nd Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Target:&mdash;2" thick, and 2' × 2-1/2', supported in a horizontal position
on a substructure as above, but resting on four piles of 6" x 6" timber.</p>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;8·9 lbs. of dynamite, enclosed in a wooden case 4" high,
and 5" × 10". It was laid with one edge on the plate, the other edge
3" above the plate; same tamping as above.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;The plate broken into three pieces, and
substructure crushed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">3rd Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Target:&mdash;5" thick, and 3' 8" × 4' 7", supported in a horizontal
position on a substructure as above, but eight piles of 6" × 6" timber
used. Plate bolted to the structure with eights.</p>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;44·4 lbs. of dynamite, enclosed in a wooden case, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
same thickness as the Harvey torpedo, and 4" × 13" × 21"; it was
placed with surface against the plate, one edge 2" and the other 5-1/2"
from the plate; tamping as before.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Plate bulged 3-1/4" in the middle; substructure
completely crushed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">4th Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Target:&mdash;5" thick, and 3' 8" × 4' 7"; this was the same plate as
used in the previous experiment, laid with bulge uppermost on two
beams under the short sides.</p>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;44·4 lbs. of dynamite, enclosed in a cylindrical tin box
7-1/2" × 2'; it was placed on top of plate 11" from one side and with
ends 9-1/2" from edge of plate; tamping as before.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;A corner of the plate broken off.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">5th Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Target:&mdash;Same plate placed vertically in the earth.</p>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;44·4 lbs. of dynamite, enclosed in a cylindrical tin box
8·5" × 18"; it was placed on timber, so as to rest against the face and
centre of the plate; tamping as usual.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Plate broken into four pieces, two of which
were large; pieces hurled over parapet, one fell at a distance of
400 feet.</p>

<p><i>Experiments at Carlscrona, Sweden, in 1874-75.</i>&mdash;These experiments
were carried out by the Swedish torpedo authorities, to ascertain the
effect of different sized charges of dynamite and gunpowder, enclosed
in divers cases, and exploded at various distances from a target which
represented in all respects, with the exception of the armour, a section
of the side of H.M.S. <i>Hercules</i> before the boiler room, she being at that
time one of the most powerful vessels afloat.</p>

<p>Target:&mdash;32' in length, and fitted into the side of an old line of
battle ship. Similar in shape to a wing tank, and comprised a double
bottom in four water-tight compartments, a wing passage in two water-tight
compartments, and two large water-tight compartments in rear of
all. It extended from 2' above the water line to within about 5' of the
vessel's keel. The thickness of the plates forming the target were:&mdash;outer
bottom, lower portion 13/16"; part where torpedo took effect, 3/4".<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Inner bottom, and wing passage bulkhead, 1/2". Vertical and longitudinal
frames, both solid and bracket, 7/16". The longitudinal frames were
bracket frames, with the exception of the second, which was solid and
water-tight, with its outer edge about 8' below the water line. The
vertical frames, of which there were seven, were placed 4' apart, the
central one being solid and water-tight, the others being bracket
frames. The ship was moored in 42 feet of water; the charges were
detonated, one fuze being used in all but No. 3 experiment, when five
fuzes were employed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">1st Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;33 lbs. of dynamite, enclosed in cylindrical steel case,
no air space; height 10·75", diameter 10·75", and thickness 1/32". It
was placed 25·5' from the target, opposite No. 7 frame, and 9·25' below
the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Ship appeared to be lifted bodily. A rivet
in the midship longitudinal bulkhead of fore compartment was
loosened. The torpedo was fired from the ship, and the shock felt
was not very great.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">2nd Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;47·2 lbs. of dynamite, in cylindrical steel case, no air
space; height 12", diameter 12", and thickness 1/32". It was placed
25·5' from No. 5 frame, 9·25' below the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Ship appeared to be lifted bodily. A leak
was started in the outer bottom opposite to charge, caused by the
loosening of five rivets.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">3rd Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;112 lbs. of gunpowder, rifle small grain, enclosed in
cylindrical steel case placed inside an iron case, with an air space all
round; steel case, 9-1/2" × 22-1/2" × 1/32"; iron case 33" × 25" × 1/4". It was
placed 12' from No. 5 frame, 9·25' below the surface.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Centre of ship lifted bodily, as if her back was
broken; ship then rolled heavily to port. On board fire engines and
troughs displaced several feet: shores and struts started, showing that
the shock was considerable. The outer bottom on each side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
centre dividing plate indented to a depth of 1 to 1-1/2 inches; numerous
rivets started, and some sheared. The leak was considerable, owing to
the number of rivets that were started. The strength of the plates was
not considered to be materially affected by the indentations; the rivets,
239 in number, were replaced; and the target prepared for the next
experiment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">4th Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;33 lbs. of dynamite, enclosed as in first experiment. It
was placed 15' from No. 7 frame, 9·25' below the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Ship rolled slightly to port. A bolt securing
the midship transverse bulkhead to beam was sheared. No damage
done to the target.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">5th Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;66 lbs. of dynamite, enclosed in steel cylindrical case,
no air space, 13·5" × 13" × 1/32". It was placed 21' from No. 3 frame, 9·25'
below the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;A rivet in outer bottom, above water line at
fore end of target, was sheared. A few rivets in outer bottom opposite
charge, and two in after compartment, were started, but no leak was
perceptible. Several shores slightly displaced.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">6th Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;33 lbs. of dynamite, enclosed as in first experiment. It
was placed 12·75' from No. 7 frame, 9·25' below the surface of the
water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Ship not lifted as much as was the case in
No. 3 experiment; but explosion much sharper. On board, fire engines
were capsized, and vertical shores displaced. Outer bottom opposite
charge indented to a depth of about 1/2 an inch, other parts less bulged,
and many rivets started.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">7th Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;33 lbs. of dynamite, enclosed as in first experiment. It
was placed 4' from No. 4 frame, 9·25' below the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Effect very great; ship hurled suddenly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
starboard. On going on board two minutes after the explosion, the
fore compartment was found full, the after compartment became full
ten minutes later. Shores and struts were considerably displaced, and
there was evidence that the ship had sustained a severe shock. Outer
bottom injured over an area 14' × 16', the plates being split in all
directions; one piece, 5' square, was torn completely off, and an irregular
hole was formed in the outer skin 14' × 12'. In the inner bottom below
the wing passage bulkhead a piece 6' × 9' was blown completely out;
the wing passage bulkhead was torn from the longitudinal frame and
split from top to bottom. The inner skin above the upper longitudinal
frame was torn from the latter, and forced in and upwards, but was not
otherwise damaged. The vertical bracket frames Nos. 3 and 4, the
latter opposite the torpedo, were destroyed, but the solid frame No. 5
was almost uninjured. The outer bottom, where it was not torn off,
was forced in 7', or 4' beyond where the <i>inner</i> bottom had been.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">8th Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;660 lbs. of gunpowder, enclosed in a buoyant cylindrical
1/4" iron case. It was placed 32·3' from No. 4 frame, 29·25" below the
surface of the water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;The ship and target had been thoroughly
repaired, and were in good condition when this experiment was made;
the ship was in this case moored in 65 feet of water. No effect was
produced on the target by the explosion.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">9th Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;19 lbs. of dynamite, enclosed in a cylindrical steel case
with arched ends. It was placed 10·5' from No. 3 frame, 9·25' below
the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Effect produced apparently equal to that by
No. 3 charge of 112 lbs. of gunpowder at 12'; indentation being from
1/2 to 1-1/4 inches in the outer skin opposite the torpedo.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">10th Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;19 lbs. of dynamite, enclosed in a case similar to that
used in the 9th experiment. It was placed 3·3' from No. 7 frame, 9·25'
below the surface of the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Hole produced in outer skin, 6·5' × 2' to 5';
inner skin only bulged and slightly cracked in two places. Above the
longitudinal frame, a bulge was made in the outer skin 8' × 7', with the
above-mentioned hole; below the longitudinal frame the indentation
was 14' × 5' and 2·1" deep, with two horizontal cracks 10' x 13', and
several inches broad.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">11th Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;112 lbs. of gunpowder, enclosed in a cylindrical case of
3/64" steel, placed in a 3/16" steel case, with 223 lbs. of buoyancy. Ignition
effected by a glass igniting bottle. It was placed 5·75' from No. 5
frame, 9·25' below the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;There was but little upcast of water outside
the ship, but a great upcast through the ship. She immediately lurched
to starboard, and on boarding her five minutes after, the target was
found full of water.</p>

<p>The effect on the target was as follows, above the 2nd longitudinal
frame, where strengthened by the wing passage bulkhead:&mdash;Outer
bottom blown away from the 4th to the 6th frames for a length of 8 feet
and a height of 4-1/2 feet, and bent in 6-1/2 feet. Inner bottom bent in
and broken through between the 4th and 5th frames, with an irregular
hole 8' square, and between the 5th and 6th frames, a similar sized
hole. Wing passage bulkhead was bent in 2" to 3", and riven for a
length of 29'; in the water-tight middle bulkhead athwartships the
rivets in two vertical joints were completely torn away.</p>

<p>Between the 2nd and 3rd longitudinal frames, and below the wing
passage bulkhead, both the inner and outer bottoms were completely
blown away for a length of 12 feet and a height of 4 feet. The
vertical and horizontal frames between the two bottoms had kept their
position unchanged, and excepting that the bracket plate by frame
No. 6 was bent, cracked, and torn away, the damage they had sustained
was limited to some comparatively slight bending. The open hole
formed in the target measured 76 square feet in outer bottom, and 60
square feet in inner bottom.</p>

<p>Comparing the effect of this torpedo with the 7th, 33 lbs. of dynamite;
with the latter charge the breach was made at the cost of the
bottom plates as well as the vertical and longitudinal frames, which
were completely torn asunder and strained; with the gunpowder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
charge, only the bottom plates were broken through, whilst the plates
whose directions were nearly parallel to the lines of explosive effect
were but little affected.</p>

<p><i>Experiments at Portsmouth, England, 1874-75.</i>&mdash;The object of these
experiments was to ascertain the effect of 500 lbs. gun-cotton torpedoes
exploded at various distances from a target representing the double
bottom of H.M.S. <i>Hercules</i>.</p>

<p>They were carried out in Stokes Bay, under the supervision of
officers belonging to the torpedo department of the Royal Engineers,
and a torpedo committee, composed of naval and military officers.</p>

<p>The <i>Oberon</i>, the vessel chosen for these experiments, was fitted with
a double bottom, representing as nearly as possible that of the <i>Hercules</i>
without the armour; also with a surface condenser, and its connections;
a donkey Kingston feed-valve; and athwartship water-tight bulkheads,
which divided the ship into seven water-tight compartments.
The outer skin was composed of 3/16" and 7/8" iron plates. In her starboard
side at different points were fixed forty-four crusher gauges, and
over each side were suspended six shots, each fitted with a crusher
gauge.</p>

<p>Displacement of the <i>Oberon</i> about 1100 tons.</p>

<p>The ship was anchored head and stern. Her mean draught of
water during the experiments was 11 feet.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">1st Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;500 lbs. of gun-cotton, in discs saturated with water,
and enclosed in an iron cylindrical case, 34" × 30" × 1/4", with arched
ends; the primer consisted of two dry discs, and two detonators. It was
placed 101' horizontal from the target, and opposite the condenser on
the starboard side; 47' below the surface of the water, on the ground.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;No damage was done to the hull, or condenser,
but light articles, such as bunker plates, gratings, tank lids, &amp;c.,
were displaced.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">2nd Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;As in first experiment. It was placed on the ground,
80' horizontal and opposite the condenser on the starboard side, 48'
below the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;No damage was done to the hull, of condenser,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
but the bunker plates, gratings, &amp;c., were displaced to a greater extent
than in the previous experiment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">3rd Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;As before. It was placed on the ground, 60' horizontal,
and opposite the condenser on the starboard side; 47' below the surface
of the water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;No damage was done to the hull. Flanges
of the condenser inlet pipe were cracked, and several of the joint
bolts were broken. The condenser had been thrown up bodily, and
had torn away its holding down bolts; but it was not as well secured
as it would have been had it formed part of the machinery of a ship.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">4th Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;As before. It was placed on the ground, 50' horizontal,
and opposite the condenser on the starboard side; 48' below the surface
of the water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Outer bottom on starboard indented over a
length of about 100', being forced in between the frames; maximum
indentation, 3/4". Many bracket frames were disturbed, and outer angle
iron of water-tight longitudinal was started for a length of 30', and
made to leak slightly. The shell of the condenser was cracked in two
places, 3' and 5' in length. Bolts securing condenser, and flanges of
pipes and valves, were all more or less damaged. Condenser was
rendered unserviceable.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">5th Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;Same charge as before, but the primer consisted of four
dry discs, and two detonators. It was placed 28·5' horizontal, opposite
No. 9 frame, on the starboard side, 36' from the stern; 48' below the
surface of the water, and 22' from the ground.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Bow observed to be lifted several feet.
Several angle irons and bracket frames were cracked, and numerous
rivets in outer bottom were broken off. The outer bottom on the
starboard side was indented between the frames, and brackets were
disturbed over a space of 100 feet; inner bottom uninjured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">6th Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;As in previous experiment. It was placed on the
ground, 28·5' horizontal, opposite No. 36 frame on the starboard side,
and 30 feet from the stern; 49·5' below the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Several plates in the outer bottom were cracked,
and outer bottom made to leak in several places, owing to the fractures in
the plates, rivets being started, and seams being opened. Considerably
more damage was effected than in previous experiment, but inner bottom
still remained uninjured.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">7th Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;As in the 5th experiment. It was placed on the ground,
immediately under the edge of the outer bottom, 39-3/4' from the target,
and opposite No. 18 frame, 70' from the stern; 50' below the surface of
the water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Outer and inner bottom broken entirely
asunder at No. 19 frame on the starboard side, and between Nos. 16
and 17 on the portside. A fracture was caused in the outer bottom
extending from the shelf plate to upper edge of strake next the keel
on the starboard side, and from the shelf plate to upper edge of flat
keel plate on the port side. A fracture was also caused in the inner
skin extending from the topside to the outer edge of the garboard
strake on the starboard side, and from the topside to upper edge of
garboard strake on the port side; this including a fracture of the keel
at No. 17. The vertical keel, the longitudinals, as well as numerous
bracket plates and angle irons, were broken, and about 2000 rivets in
the outer bottom were rendered defective.</p>

<p>The outer bottom was indented over a considerable length, the
indentation being greatest between the frames, and the maximum
being 8 inches. The inner bottom was not indented or damaged,
with the exception of the fractures before mentioned.</p>

<p><i>Experiments at Pola, Austria, 1875.</i>&mdash;These experiments were carried
out to determine the effect of very heavy charges of dynamite on an iron
pontoon fitted with a double bottom, similar to that of H.M.S. <i>Hercules</i>.</p>

<p>Target:&mdash;An iron pontoon 60' long and 40' beam, with circular
ends and fitted with a double bottom, also a condenser and two
Kingston valves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">1st Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;617 lbs. of dynamite. It was 62' horizontally from the
keel, 53' actual distance from the side, and opposite amidships, 40·5'
below the surface of the water, and 20' from the ground.</p>

<p>Pontoon:&mdash;Draught of water 19', and moored in 62' of water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;The pontoon moved away bodily a distance
of 13 feet; a few rivets in the outer bottom were started, and the
outer skin was slightly indented between the frames; the maximum
indentation being 1·5". No other damage was sustained by the hull.
Several of the screws securing the flanges of the Kingston valves were
slightly loosened.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">2nd Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;585 lbs. of dynamite. It was placed 60' horizontally
from the keel, 48' actual distance from the side, and opposite amidships;
36' below the surface of the water, and 42' from the ground.</p>

<p>Pontoon:&mdash;Draught of water 19·5', and moored in 74' of water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;The pontoon, which had been more rigidly
moored than in the previous experiment, was moved bodily away a
distance of 4 feet. Many rivets were loosened, and a few connecting
the angle irons were sheared; also the outer skin was slightly indented.
No damage was done to the condenser or Kingston valves.</p>

<p><i>Experiment in the Sea of Marmora, 1875.</i>&mdash;This experiment was
carried out by Turkish officers attached to their naval school at Halki,
an island in the Sea of Marmora, about eight miles from Stamboul.
It consisted in destroying a Turkish schooner by the explosion of an
100-lb. gun-cotton mine in contact with her, moored in 58 feet of
water, and 10 feet beneath the surface.</p>

<p><i>Experiment at Carlscrona, Sweden, 1876.</i>&mdash;This experiment was a
continuation of those previously carried out in 1874-75, and which have
been detailed at <a href="#Page_224">page 224</a>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Target:&mdash;The same as had been used for the previous experiments
(1874-75), and which had been thoroughly repaired.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;660 lbs. of gunpowder, enclosed in a buoyant cylindrical
1/4" steel case with domed ends, and contained in an inner 1/16" steel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
case. It was ignited by two Von Ebner fuzes placed in a charge of
1/4 lb. of gunpowder and enclosed in a glass bottle. It was placed 5'
horizontally from the water line, 23·75' actual distance from target,
and opposite No. 5 (middle) frame of target, 29' below the surface of
the water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;The ship was moored in 54' of water. She
was lifted by the explosion, rolled over to port, and then settled to
starboard, sundry large pieces of timber being thrown up in the air.
The outer bottom of the target was broken through above the second
longitudinal frame, from the fourth to the seventh frames laterally, and
from the top of the target to the second longitudinal frame vertically,
the hole made measuring about 9' high by 12' wide, or about 100
square feet in area. The inner bottom was also broken through
between the top of the target and second longitudinal frame, and
between the fourth and seventh vertical frames, the hole made being
about 75 square feet in area. The bracket frames within the damaged
area were but little damaged. The wing passage bulkhead was broken
through opposite to Nos. 5 and 7 frames, the holes made being respectively
18 and 17 square feet in area. Through these holes the
force of the explosion had made its way to the horizontal iron deck,
forming the top of the target, which was completely broken through
a little abaft No. 5 frame, the hole made measuring about 100 square
feet in area. A piece of this iron deck, weighing, with the iron fastenings
attached to it, about 1650 lbs., was thrown 16' against the upper
deck beams. The target below the second longitudinal frame was
comparatively but little injured. The outer bottom was indented and
cracked in one or two places, but the inner bottom was uninjured. In
addition to the damage to the target, the ship herself sustained serious
injury, eleven of the lower deck beams, with their knees being broken
(six being broken completely across). The main keel immediately
under the target was also opened at the scarf, and the back of the
ship was apparently broken. The hull had given out laterally to
such an extent as to prevent the ship being taken into dock.</p>

<p><i>Experiments at Portsmouth, England, 1876.</i>&mdash;The object of the
following experiments was to determine the effect of comparatively
small charges of gunpowder and gun-cotton exploded in actual contact
with an ironclad, as would be the case in a torpedo attack either with
locomotive towing or spar torpedoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Target:&mdash;the same as used in the experiments of 1874-5, which
have been detailed at <a href="#Page_229">page 229</a>, &amp;c., viz., the <i>Oberon</i> fitted to represent
H.M.S. <i>Hercules</i> without the armour. Her mean draught was 11', and
she was moored in 26-1/2' of water. The <i>Oberon</i> had been placed in a
thorough state of repair.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">1st Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;60 lbs. of gun-cotton in slabs, saturated with water.
Total weight of charge 75 lbs. It was enclosed in a 1/4" iron case with
cast iron ends. It was placed at 15' actual distance from the nearest
side of the case to the target, and opposite No. 4 frame on the port
side, 10' below the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Effect of the explosion:&mdash;The effect upon the vessel was unappreciable.
This charge represented the large Whitehead fish
torpedo, and its position corresponded to that of this torpedo when
striking a net at a small angle with the keel.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">2nd Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;The Harvey towing torpedo, charged with 66 lbs. of
gunpowder, primed with gunpowder, and fired by means of an electric
fuze. It was placed at 3' actual distance from the target, measuring
from the centre of the torpedo, and opposite No. 4 solid frame on the
starboard side, the vertical axis of the torpedo being at right angles
to the vessel's side, 9-1/4' below the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;This and the two following torpedoes were
fired simultaneously. The outer bottom was blown in from the upper
edge of the flat keel plate to the underside of the water-tight
longitudinal, and fore and aft from No. 2 to No. 6 frames; an area
16' × 8-5/6'. Flat keel plates were broken between No. 2 and No. 4
frames, and the 4th strake of the bottom plating was broken, and the
frames for that space blown in. Two holes were blown through the
inner bottom, measuring respectively 2' × 2' and 7' × 1', making the
total area of the inner bottom destroyed, 11 square feet.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">3rd Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;33 lbs. of granulated gun-cotton, saturated with water;
total weight of charge being about 41 lbs. It was enclosed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
1/4" iron case, 12-1/2" × 12" × 12-1/2", the primer being 2-1/2 lbs. of slab gun-cotton,
included in the 33 lbs. It was placed at 4' actual distance from
the target, measuring from the centre of the case, and opposite No. 30-1/2
solid frame on the starboard side; 9-1/4' below the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Outer bottom blown in from upper edge of
the lower longitudinal to the lower edge of the upper longitudinal
between Nos. 28 and 32 frames; an area of 18 × 11 feet. The butts
of the flat keel were started and the plating broken across No. 30-1/2
frame from the flat keel plate to the upper deck. Shelf plate at Nos. 30-1/2
and 32-1/2 frames was broken. Nos. 29, 30, and 31 frames were blown in
from first to third longitudinal; lower longitudinal from No. 28 to 31
also blown in. Two holes were blown through the inner bottom,
measuring respectively 6 × 1·5' and 5' × ·25', making the total area of
inner bottom destroyed 10 square feet. A steam launch with steam up
and outrigger torpedo gear in place, one pole being rigged out, was
placed with the stem of the boat 22' horizontally from the torpedo.
She was uninjured and shipped very little water.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">4th Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>Torpedo:&mdash;31 lbs. 14 oz. of gun-cotton in slabs, saturated with
water, total weight about 40 lbs. It was enclosed in a 1/4" iron case
12-1/2" × 12-1/2" × 6"; primer being 20 oz. of gun-cotton, included in the
31 lbs. 14 oz. It was placed at 4' actual distance from the target
measuring from the centre of the case, and opposite No. 30-1/2 solid
frame on the port side; 9-1/4' below the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Effect of explosion:&mdash;Outer bottom and frames injured in a similar
manner to that described in the third experiment. Outer angle irons
of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd longitudinals were started in the wake of the
broken place. A hole was blown through the inner bottom, measuring
9·5' × 1', or about 10 square feet in area. The bolts of the outer
bottom plate of stern post much open, and at Nos. 16 and 17 on the
port side the upper two strakes were buckled and the shelf plate
started.</p>

<p>A steam launch, arranged in the same manner as in the fourth
experiment, was uninjured, and shipped but little water.</p>

to pack the dynamite very carefully, using at the same time special
precautions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<small>THE ELECTRIC LIGHT&mdash;TORPEDO GUNS&mdash;DIVING.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>ELECTRIC lights combined with fast steam launches as guard boats
and specially constructed torpedo guns, such as the Nordenfelt
and Hotchkiss machine guns, are at the present time the only <i>truly
practicable</i> means afforded to a man-of-war of defending herself against
the attack of torpedo boats, whether these latter are armed with the
spar, fish, or towing torpedo; the torpedo gun sinking the boats
after the electric light and guard boats have detected their approach
and position.</div>

<p>As has been before stated, nets, shields, booms, &amp;c., placed around
a vessel of war, must, however slightly constructed, affect to a considerable
degree her efficiency, by decreasing her power of moving quickly
in any desired direction, which is essential to the utility of such a
vessel in time of war; and thus on electric lights, guard boats, and
torpedo guns must the safety of ships in future wars really depend,
when attacked by torpedo boats.</p>

<p><i>The Electric Light.</i>&mdash;The phenomenon of the <i>Voltaic arc</i> was first
discovered by Sir Humphry, then Mr., Davy at the beginning of the
present century. The following is an account of the matter as given
by him in his "Elements of Chemical Philosophy":&mdash;</p>

<p>"The most powerful combination that exists, in which number of
alternations is combined with extent of surface, is that constructed by
the subscription of a few zealous cultivators and patrons of science in
the laboratory of the Royal Institution. It consists of 200 instruments,
connected together in regular order, each composed of ten double
plates arranged in cells of porcelain, and containing in each plate
thirty-two square inches; so that the whole number of double plates
is 2,000, and the whole surface 128,000 square inches. This battery,
when the cells were filled with sixty parts of water, mixed with one
part of nitric acid, and one part of sulphuric acid, afforded a series of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
brilliant and impressive effects. When pieces of charcoal about an
inch long and one-sixth of an inch in diameter were brought near each
other (within the thirtieth or fortieth part of an inch), a bright spark
was produced, and more than half the volume of the charcoal became
ignited to whiteness, and by withdrawing the points from each other,
a constant discharge took place through the heated air, in a space equal
at least to four inches; producing a most brilliant ascending arch of
light, broad, and conical in form in the middle. When any substance
was introduced into this arch, it instantly became ignited. Platina
melted as readily in it as wax in the flame of a common candle; quartz,
the sapphire, magnesia, lime, all entered into fusion; fragments of
diamond, and points of charcoal and plumbago, rapidly disappeared,
and seemed to evaporate in it, even when the connection was made in
a receiver exhausted by the air pump; but there was no evidence of
their having previously undergone fusion."</p>

<p>The philosopher also showed that, when the Voltaic or electric arc
is produced in the exhausted receiver of an air pump, the phenomena
are as brilliant in character, and the charcoal points can be more
widely separated, thus proving that the electric light is quite independent
of the oxygen of the air for its support.</p>

<p>Owing to the crude nature of the Voltaic batteries of that day, and
also to the great expense of maintaining a large battery of that nature,
nothing practical resulted from Davy's discovery of the electric or
Voltaic arc. Professor Faraday, the great physicist, by his discovery
of the principle of magneto-electricity, has enabled the electric light
to be brought into practical use. As early as 1833 Pixii applied
the principle practically in the construction of a magneto-electric
machine with revolving magnets; he was followed by Laxton, Clark,
Nollet, Holmes, and others, who made machines with fixed magnets.
In 1854 Dr. Werner Siemens, of Berlin, introduced the "Siemens'
Armature," which, from its compact form, permitted a very high
velocity of rotation in an intense magnetic field, giving powerful
alternating currents, which, when required, were commutated into one
direction.</p>

<p>The latest improvement has been that from the magneto-electric
to the dynamo-electric machine. It is due to both Dr. Siemens
and Sir C. Wheatstone. Induced currents are directed through the
coils of the electro-magnets which produce them, increasing their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
magnetic intensity, which in its turn strengthens the induced
currents, and so on, accumulating by mutual action until a limit is
reached.</p>

<p><i>Siemens' Electric Light.</i>&mdash;The following is a description of Messrs.
Siemens Brothers' dynamo-electric light apparatus, which, for use on
board ship against boat torpedo attacks, &amp;c., is equal, if not superior,
to any similar apparatus yet produced, and which is extensively used
in the German and other European navies. This apparatus was one
of many others experimented on by Dr. Tyndal and Mr. Douglas,
M.I.C.E., for the Trinity House.</p>

<p>Dr. Tyndal says: "I entirely concur in the recommendation of
Mr. Douglas, that the Siemens machine recently tried at the South
Foreland be adopted for the Lizard. From the first I regarded the
performance of this handy little instrument as wonderful. It is simple
in principle, and so moderate in cost that a reserve of power can always
be maintained without much outlay. By coupling two such machines
together, a great augmentation of the light is moreover obtainable."</p>

<p><i>Principle.</i>&mdash;When a closed electrical circuit is moved in the neighbourhood
of a magnetic pole, so as to cut the lines of magnetic force,
a current is generated in the circuit, the direction of which depends
upon whether the magnetic pole is N or S; it also depends on the
direction of motion of the circuit, and according to the law of Lenz,
the current generated is always such as to oppose the motion of the
closed circuit.</p>

<p>All magneto-electric and dynamo-electric machines are based on the
principle stated above, and are subject to many modifications.</p>

<p>The name <i>dynamo</i>-electric machine is given to it, because the
electric current is not induced by a <i>permanent magnet</i>, but is accumulated
by the mutual action of electro-magnets and a revolving wire
cylinder or armature. It is found that, as the dynamic force required
to drive the machine increases, so also does the electric current; it is
therefore called a dynamo-electric machine.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;In the machine here described, of which <a href="#Fig_164">Fig. 164</a> is an
elevation, <a href="#Fig_173">Fig. 173</a> a part elevation, and <a href="#Fig_165">Fig. 165</a> a longitudinal section,
the electric current is produced by the rotation of an insulated conductor
of copper wire or armature coiled in several lengths, 8, 12, 16,
&amp;c., up to 28, and in several layers, longitudinally, upon a cylinder
with a stationary iron core <i>nn' ss'</i>, so that the whole surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the armature is covered with longitudinal wires and closed at both
ends, as in <a href="#Fig_165">Fig. 165</a>. This revolving armature is enclosed to the extent
of two-thirds of its cylindrical surface by curved soft iron bars
<i>NN</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>SS</i><sub>1</sub>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_363.jpg" width="500" height="367" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Fig_164">Fig. 164</a>.</div>
</div>

<p>The curved bars are the prolongations of the cores of the electro-magnets
<i>E E E E</i>. They are held firmly together by screws to the
sides or bottom of the cast iron frame of the machine, making it
compact and strong.</p>

<p>The coils of the electro-magnet form with the wires of the revolving
armature one continuous electric circuit, and, when the armature is
caused to rotate, an electric current (which at first is very feeble) is
induced by the remanent magnetism in the soft iron bars and directed
through the collecting brushes into the electro-magnet coils, thus
strengthening the magnetism of the iron bars,<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a> which again induce a
still more powerful current in the revolving armature.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>
<p>The electric current thus becomes stronger and stronger, and the
armature therefore revolves in a magnetic field of the highest
intensity, the limit of which is governed by the limit of saturation of
the soft iron.</p>

<p>At each revolution the maximum magnetic effect upon each convolution
of the armature is produced just after it passes through the
middle of both magnetic fields, which are in a vertical plane passing
through the axis of the machine (i. e. <i>N</i><sub>1</sub><i>S</i><sub>1</sub> in Fig. 173). The minimum
effect is produced when in a plane at right angles to it, i. e. horizontal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_364.jpg" width="500" height="219" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Fig_165">Fig. 165</a>.</div>
</div>

<p>According to the law of Lenz already referred to, when a circuit
starts from a neutral position on one side of an axis towards the pole
of a magnet, it has a direct current induced in it, and the other part
of the circuit which approaches the opposite pole of the magnet has
an inverse current induced in it; these two induced currents are,
however, in the same direction as regards circuit. A similar current
will also be induced in all the convolutions of wire in succession as
they approach the poles of the magnets.</p>

<p>These currents, almost as soon as they are induced, are collected
by terminal rollers or brushes <i>B</i>, usually the latter, placed in contact
with the commutator in the position which gives the strongest current.
The position giving the strongest current gives also the least spark, so
that when there are no sparks at the commutator the best lighting
effect is produced. <a href="#Fig_166">Fig. 166</a> shows position of brushes when the
armature revolves in the direction indicated by the arrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>The circumference of the revolving armature is divided into an
even number of equal parts, each opposite pair being filled with convolutions
of insulated wire wound parallel to the axis of the armature.</p>

<p>The ends of these wires are brought to a commutator and connected
to the segments either by screws or by soldering.</p>

<p>The brushes collect the electric currents as they are induced,
which is nearly constant and continuous.</p>

<p>The collecting brushes are combs of copper wire placed tangentially
to the cylindrical commutator, and press lightly upon it with an elastic
pressure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_365.jpg" width="400" height="230" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Fig_166">Fig. 166</a>.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Power and Light produced.</i>&mdash;An increase of the armature speed
produces a corresponding increase in the current produced, but not in
the same proportion. The current increases more rapidly than the
speed, and could be made to reach any intensity but for considerations
explained below. With increase of current there is also increase of
heat.</p>

<p>The speed for continuous work must not be taken too high, because
the heat developed at high velocities might destroy the insulation of
the coils of the electro-magnet. The speed given for this machine
produces no such injurious heating effect.</p>

<p>The strength of the current is also influenced by the resistance of
the electric lamp and its leading wires. With an electric lamp in a
circuit of proper resistance the armature should revolve at the rate
given in the following Table. The heating will then reach its
maximum, which is very moderate, in about three hours after which
there will be no further change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

</table></div>

<p>The intensity of the unassisted light is given in standard candles.
The standard here used is a stearine candle consuming 10 grammes
per hour.</p>

<p><i>Regulation.</i>&mdash;From the fact that a closed circuit rotating in a magnetic
field experiences resistance to its motion which a broken circuit
does not, motive power to any extent is only required when the circuit
is closed. An interruption of the current is therefore equivalent to
removing the load from the motor, which for mechanical reasons may
be injurious to it and for electrical reasons to the dynamo machine.</p>

<p>The sudden interruption of the circuit of the large machine produces
an electric tension so dangerously high as to strain or destroy
the insulation of the machine. When contact is again made after
such interruption, the increase of speed resulting from the interruption
causes a momentary current of great intensity, accompanied by sparks
at the commutator.</p>

<p>In order that the light may be quite steady the speed should be as
uniform as possible. As too high an increase of speed may result
in temporary extinction of the light, it ought never to be permitted.
The motor should therefore be provided with a good and sensitive
governor, that will keep the speed perfectly uniform however the
steam and load may vary. A large and heavy fly-wheel is also very
useful in keeping the speed nearly uniform during change of load.</p>

<p>Although the circuit, when the machine is in full action, should
never be suddenly interrupted, interruption arising from the extinction
of the light is <i>not</i> dangerous, because it is always preceded by a decrease
in the strength of the current. When it is desired to divert the
current into another circuit it is advisable to stop the machine. Although
in practice with small machines this is rarely done, with large
machines it is necessary.</p>

<p><i>Self-acting Shunt.</i>&mdash;For great security, especially with the two
machines coupled together, where the electric current is strong and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the light equivalent to about 14,000 candles, it is advisable to insert in
the circuit a self-acting shunt.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_367.jpg" width="300" height="394" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Fig_167">Fig. 167</a>.</div>
</div>

<p>This is placed between the
lamp and machine and connected
to both leading wires. Its
principle is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The terminal <i>M</i>, <a href="#Fig_167">Fig. 167</a>, is
joined by a short connecting
wire to one terminal of the
machine. The terminal <i>L M</i> is
connected to the remaining terminal
of the machine and also
to one of the lamp terminals.</p>

<p>The terminal <i>L</i> is connected
to the other terminal of the
lamp.</p>

<p>The shunt contains a small
electro-magnet <i>E</i> mounted upon
a square wooden slab or baseboard
with its armature a, a contact
c, and, below the slab, a resistance coil <i>W</i>, which is equal to the
resistance of the electric arc of the light, about 1 S. <i>u.</i><a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a></p>

<p>As long as the lamp is burning well, the current circulates in the
coils of the electro-magnet, and the armature <i>a</i> being strongly
attracted, there is no contact at <i>c</i>. The resistance coil <i>W</i> is therefore
not in electrical circuit. When the light is extinguished the current
in the coils of the electro-magnet ceases, and the armature is withdrawn
by the spring <i>f</i> making contact at <i>c</i>. This offers to the electric
current a path through <i>W</i> of equal resistance to that of the lamp, and
the current is subjected to scarcely any change, so that the motor has
practically no cause to alter its rate.</p>

<p>When the carbon points of the lamp again touch, the electric
current returns to them, breaking contact at <i>c</i>, re-establishing the
former conditions.</p>

<p><i>Direction of Rotation.</i>&mdash;The armature may revolve in either direction.
If it becomes necessary to drive it in the opposite direction to that
for which the machine has been made, it is only necessary to reverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the brushes, placing their points in the direction of motion, and to
change two of the wire connections, which operations can be effected
in a few minutes. <a href="#Fig_166">Fig. 166</a> shows the position of brushes for one
direction of rotation and <a href="#Fig_168">Fig. 168</a> that for the other.</p>

<p><i>Conducting or Leading Wires.</i>&mdash;The leading wires are usually of
copper of high electrical conductivity. They must be insulated from
one another the whole of their length and not placed too close together.
As their resistance affects the intensity of the light very much, the
section must be carefully proportioned to the distance of the lamp from
the machine.</p>

<p>The best practical result is obtained when their resistance together
with that of the lamp is equal to the total internal resistance of the
dynamo machine. Wires of various sizes are therefore required.</p>

<p>Decrease in strength of the current caused by a leading wire of
too high resistance can be overcome by a higher velocity, which is
obtained only by increased motive power, but if the wire is much too
small, it will become heated. The proper remedy is to increase the
sectional area of the leading wire.</p>

<p>Bright sparks should never be allowed to appear at the commutator
and brushes, as sparks result from a rapid burning of the metallic
parts. They can easily be avoided by properly inclining the two arms
which carry the brushes.</p>

<p>The position of the brushes yielding the least spark at the commutator
is that giving the highest intensity of light in the electric arc.</p>

<p>The commutator should, while in motion, be freely oiled, to prevent
the brushes wearing away too rapidly. The sticky oil should from
time to time be removed by washing with paraffine oil or benzoline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wear and Tear.</i>&mdash;The chances of stoppage so common to the old
forms of electric light apparatus have in this form been reduced to a
minimum, and now do not exceed those that arise with machines
generally. The Trinity House Report states that the Siemens' machine
worked well for a month without any necessity for stopping. The brushes
are the only parts which wear away, and they are very easily replaced.</p>

<p>In thick weather they should be connected in what is called parallel
circuit (or parallel arc, or for "quantity"), because it has been found
that when they are so arranged the intensity of the electric light produced
exceeds by some twenty per cent. the intensity of the sum of the
two when worked separately. Thus the two machines, giving respectively
a candle power of 4,446 and 6,563 when worked separately (total
11,009), have given when coupled up in parallel circuit a light equivalent
to 13,179 candles; just as in telegraphy it has been found that
the rate of sending can be increased from 20 to 25 per cent. when the
apparatus is coupled up in parallel arc. For this reason it is usual to
employ two machines of medium size instead of one machine of large
size. The intense light so produced is also much more uniform than
from one large machine.</p>

<p><i>Automatic Electric Lamp.</i>&mdash;Automatic electric lamps have been
constructed with spring clockwork to cause the carbons to approach one
another to a certain point, when, by means of an electro-magnet, the
clockwork is checked, and the carbon points are allowed to burn away
to such a distance that, by the decrease of current, the clockwork is
released and the carbons caused to approach again. With such lamps
the clockwork has been a source of trouble, and it is liable to get out
of order.</p>

<p><i>Siemens' Patent Electric Lamp.</i>&mdash;The lamp here described is actuated
without clockwork; it also automatically separates the carbons after
they have approached too closely or touch, and, by this combined action
of approaching and separating, the carbon points are kept at a proper
distance apart, and a steady light is obtained.</p>

<p>The working parts are represented in the diagram <a href="#Fig_169">Fig. 169</a>, and at
<a href="#Fig_170">Fig. 170</a> is shown the size employed on board ship.</p>

<p><i>E</i> is the horse-shoe magnet with the armature <i>A</i> placed in front of
its poles a short distance from them. A regulating screw <i>b</i> with the
spiral spring <i>f</i> is attached to the lever <i>A'</i>, forcing it against the stop <i>d</i>,
and withdrawing the armature from the poles of the electro-magnet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
When a current traverses the coils of the latter of sufficient strength
to attract the armature and overcome the tension of the spring <i>f</i>, contact
is made at <i>c</i>, which diverts the
current from those coils. The consequent
release of the armature breaks contact at
<i>c</i>, the armature is again attracted, and
this action is repeated, producing a vibrating
motion of the lever and armature,
which continues as long as there is sufficient
current to overcome the tension of
the spring.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 179px;">
<img src="images/i_370.jpg" width="179" height="400" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_169"></a>Fig. 169.</div>
</div>

<p>The spring pawl <i>s</i> at the upper end
of the lever <i>A'</i>, and oscillating with it,
actuates a ratchet-wheel <i>u</i>, which is in
gear with a train of wheels and the
carbon holders; it thus opposes their
tendency to approach by pushing them
apart, tooth by tooth, until the current
is so much weakened by the increased
length of electric arc that the armature
and lever cease to oscillate enough to
move the teeth of the ratchet-wheel, and
it rests near the stop <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>While in this position the spring
pawl is released from the ratchet-wheel
and the preponderating weight of the
upper carbon holder causes the carbon points to approach again.
Increase of current follows decrease of resistance, the armature again
oscillates, and this cycle of action is continuously repeated.</p>

<p>When in action the movements of the carbons are scarcely perceptible,
but when, by any external cause, the carbons are separated so as
to extinguish the light, they immediately run together until they
touch, when they ignite and separate to a proper working distance by
means of the electro-magnet above described.</p>

<p>The only operation requiring attention in the use of this lamp is
the adjustment of the tension of the spring <i>f</i>. When this tension is
once regulated to the current at disposal, the lamp will continue to
give a steady light as long as the current remains uniform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>The relative rate of consumption of the two carbon points differs.
The positive carbon burns away rather more than twice as quickly as
the negative carbon.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_371.jpg" width="250" height="535" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_170"></a>Fig. 170.</div>
</div>

<p>The duration of the light depends mainly
on the lengths and sizes of the carbons.</p>

<p>Provision is made in this lamp that the
rack which supports the negative carbon may
be made to gear either into the teeth of the
same pinion as that of the positive carbon,
or into one of about half the size. By these
means the light, when once focussed in a
reflector, will remain in focus as long as the
carbons last, whether permanent or reversed
currents are employed.</p>

<p>Besides its twofold application, the lamp
is very compact, is simple in construction,
and therefore not likely to get out of order,
and it is capable of being regulated with
great precision.</p>

<p>There is no spring to be wound up. The
contact need not be cleaned, as the sparks
are scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p>By removing two screws in the outside casing, all the chief working
parts can be easily removed and inspected.</p>

<p>Carbons are made from the hard carbon deposited in the interior of
gas retorts, also from graphite. Various sizes, both square and round
in section, of from 5 to 20 mm. in diameter, are used in the electric
lamp according to the intensity of the electric current. Those
commonly employed are from 10 to 12 mm. in diameter.</p>

<p>The carbons supplied with the Siemens patent lamp are coated
with a thin film of copper. This enhances the cost somewhat, but it
greatly improves the result, as the carbons burn longer, and do not
split, when so coated.</p>

<p>By coating them the resistance is diminished, except at the points,
so that all the heat is concentrated in the electric arc, and a brighter
light is the result.</p>

<p>When two dynamo machines are coupled together (see <a href="#Page_248">page 248</a>),
to give a very powerful current, the sizes up to 20 mm. are required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The consumption varies a little, but the average is from 3 to 4
inches per hour.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 249px;">
<img src="images/i_372.jpg" width="249" height="350" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_171"></a>Fig. 171.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Concentration of Light.</i>&mdash;Two kinds of concentrating apparatus are
supplied in combination with the automatic lamp, both of which are
capable of giving a powerful parallel beam, which will reach to an
enormous distance, and are well adapted for naval purposes. The one
kind consists of a parabolic reflector of stout metal, its concave surface
being silvered and burnished. The apparatus is mounted with a ball-and-socket
joint upon a wooden stand, as shown in <a href="#Fig_171">Fig. 171</a>.</p>

<p>The other kind is the Fresnel catadioptric lens or holophote,
<a href="#Fig_172">Fig. 172</a>, which may be substituted for the reflector, and gives a more
powerful beam than one given by reflection. The lens is surrounded
by a metal case or lantern, in which is placed the electric lamp upon
a slide for focussing. Behind the carbon points a hemispherical
reflector is placed, to catch all the back rays, and reflect them back
through the lamp focus. The entire lantern is capable of revolving on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
horizontal rollers, and swings upon pivots. Two handles are placed at
the back to manipulate it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 279px;">
<img src="images/i_373.jpg" width="279" height="400" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_172"></a>Fig. 172.</div>
</div>

<p>As the electric arc is much too bright to be looked into with the
naked eye, both concentrating apparatus are supplied with a lens,
called a focus or flame observer, by means of which an image of the
burning carbons is thrown upon small screens at the back, so that the
lamp can be easily adjusted without fatigue to the eye. The focus
observer is shown on the lamp in holophote, <a href="#Fig_172">Fig. 172</a>.</p>

<p><i>Precautions.</i>&mdash;Before starting the apparatus, the electric lamp
terminals and those of the dynamo machine must be <i>connected up</i> by
means of the leading wires provided with each set of apparatus. The
terminals are marked <i>C</i> and <i>Z</i> respectively, and they should be connected,
<i>C</i> of machine to <i>C</i> of the lamp, and <i>Z</i> of the machine to <i>Z</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the lamp, in order that the electric current may be sent in the proper
direction through the carbons of the lamp. Should it, however, be
found that the top carbon (which should consume twice as fast as that
of the bottom one) does not consume so fast as the bottom one, it may
be assumed that the dynamo machine has reversed its poles, and the
leading wires will consequently require changing across. This reversal
of poles, though possible, is of <i>very rare</i> occurrence.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_374.jpg" width="450" height="207" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_173"></a>Fig. 173.</div>
</div>

<p>The dynamo-electric machine should not be driven without its
proper leading wires to lamp and lamp being connected up, or at
least an external resistance equivalent to that of the lamp (which is
approximately one Siemens' unit) must be inserted. In other words,
the machine must not be driven when a wire of small resistance connects
the two terminals <i>C</i> and <i>Z</i>. This is expressed more briefly by
saying the machine must not be <i>short-circuited</i>. If it is short-circuited
when in motion the electric current becomes so powerful that it will
leap from segment to segment of the commutator, where very bright
and large sparks will be seen, and if continued would destroy the
insulation, thus weakening the current generated.</p>

<p>The leading wires should never be disconnected suddenly while
the machine is revolving at its full speed, as such a sudden interruption
will produce an intense spark, which will burn the ends of the
wire where the contact is suddenly broken. When it becomes necessary
to disconnect the wires, the belt should be pushed on to the loose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
pulley by means of the striking gear, or the steam engine should be
stopped.</p>

<p>It may be here stated that all connections should be cleaned
bright and screwed tightly, to ensure perfect metallic contacts being
made.</p>

<p><i>Coupling two Machines.</i>&mdash;At <a href="#Fig_174">Fig. 174</a> is shown a diagram of how to
make the connections when coupling two machines in parallel circuit.
<i>MM'</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>m'</i>, represent the ends of the wires of the electro-magnets;
<i>BB'</i> are the branches; <i>C</i> and <i>Z</i> are the terminals of each machine
respectively.</p>

<div class="caption"><a id="Fig_174"></a>Fig. 174.</div>
</div>

<p>The three ways in which the various wire connections of these
machines are joined up, and which are enough for all ordinary purposes,
are given below in paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), and (<i>c</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) When the machine is working <i>singly</i> and revolving in the
direction indicated in <a href="#Fig_166">Fig. 166</a>, the following connections are made:&mdash;</p>

<td align="center">"</td>
<td align="left"><i>C</i>,</td>
</tr>
</table></div>


<div class='unindent'>and the leading wires of the lamp are connected with <i>C</i> and with <i>Z</i>
as explained.</div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) When working <i>singly</i> and revolving in the direction indicated
in Fig. 168:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="more connections">
<tr><td align="left"><i>M</i>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left">is connected to&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><i>B'</i>,</td>

<tr><td align="left"><i>M'</i></td>
<td align="center">"</td>
<td align="left"><i>B</i>,</td>

</tr>
<tr><td align="left"><i>m'</i></td>
<td align="center">"</td>
<td align="left"><i>C</i>.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>


<div class='unindent'>Thus the only change necessary when the machine is to be driven in
the opposite direction to that for which it is made, is to disconnect at
<i>B</i> the wire from <i>M</i> to <i>B</i> and at <i>B'</i> the wire from <i>M'</i> to <i>B'</i>, and to cross
them. The machine will then be connected as above (<i>b</i>).</div>

<p>(<i>c</i>) When working <i>two</i> machines in parallel circuit, as in <a href="#Fig_174">Fig. 174</a>,
they must be connected as follows (that on the left of the page being
called the first machine, and that on the right the second machine):&mdash;</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="more connections">
<tr><td align="left"><i>C</i>&nbsp;</td>

<td align="center">"</td>
</tr>
</table></div>


<div>and then connect <i>C</i> and <i>Z</i> of the second machine with the leading
wires of the lamp.</div>

<p>The connections <i>m</i> to <i>Z</i> and <i>m'</i> to <i>C</i> in each machine are the same
as in cases (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>). They do not require to be altered, and may
therefore be left out of consideration in all three cases (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), and (<i>c</i>).
The whole of the connections here indicated can be quickly made by
means of a cross-bar commutator or switch, which is supplied with the
machines in cases where such changes are likely to be required
frequently. This is usually attached to a wall, leading wires being
taken to it from the dynamo machines separately, and others from the
switch being led to the electric lamps.</p>

<p>The leading wires from machine to lamp should, whenever possible,
be kept <i>separate</i>, to prevent them rubbing together and making contact.
A distance of two inches is quite sufficient to prevent accidents
of any kind.</p>

<p>When the leading wires are erected in places where they are likely
to rub and chafe against hard substances, it is advisable to enclose each
wire separately in india-rubber tubing at all the points where they are
likely to be rubbed. This becomes very important on board ship,
where everything is in motion, and special care is in consequence
required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Some dynamo machines are coupled direct to the crank shaft of
the steam engines; they require the same kind of attention as others,
that is to say, they should be driven at a uniform speed, should be
well oiled as well as the steam-engine, and they should be kept clean
and free from sharp grit.</p>

<p><i>Application.</i>&mdash;The electric light used in the case of a <i>direct</i> attack
by torpedo boats, without the assistance of guard boats, will not prove
of much assistance, on account of the very small space covered by the
beam of light, and therefore if the direction of attack is not exactly
known, the beam of light must be kept continually sweeping round
the horizon on the chance of picking out the attacking boats, and
thus, while flashing in one direction, they may be approaching in
another, and effect their deadly mission.</p>

<p>Every man-of-war should be fitted with at least three electric lights,
whereby the above-mentioned want of space covered would be to a
considerable degree obviated.</p>

<p>If a powerful beam of light be thrown in a particular direction,
and there kept stationary, all boats or vessels crossing its path at a
distance not exceeding 1600 yards from the ship using the electric
light, would become distinctly visible to observers placed behind the
light; these vessels remaining visible as long as they continue in such
a position that the beam of light acts as a background to them.
Under very favourable circumstances, the distance at which the above
effect may be observed is much increased.</p>

<p>The parabolic reflector extends only about an arc of 33° at 540
yards' distance from the light.</p>

<p>One defect of this form of reflector is, that it is rapidly dimmed
by spray, rain, and by the particles given off by the carbons.</p>

<p>The catadioptric lens, or holophote, gives a far more powerful but
a more concentrated beam than the parabolic reflector. By means of
such a beam of light, a torpedo boat may be discerned at about one
mile distance. By adding divergent lens to the holophote, a less
powerful and less concentrated beam of light will be thrown out; in
this case about 20° of surrounding water would be well illuminated at
about 900 yards' distance, while without the divergent lens there
would be only about 5° so illuminated but far more brilliantly.</p>

<p>The distance at which objects can be detected by the electric
light depends on their size and <i>colour</i>, more particularly on the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>The observer should as a rule be well removed from the light.</p>

<p>In the case of an electric light being thrown on the observer, the
vessel, &amp;c., using it would to that observer be invisible, the light only
being seen; also when directed on any particular object, surrounding
objects would be thrown into shade.</p>

<p>The electric light will be found very useful for signal purposes by
fitting a plane mirror in front of the catadioptric lens; so arranged
that it be turned to any desired angle to the axis of the beam of light.
By altering the angle of the mirror, the reflected beam of light can
be swept from the horizon on one side, through the zenith, to the
horizon on the other side. The time of passing the zenith being
equivalent to the long and short flashes of the usual night signal
code.</p>

<p>In addition to using the electric light to detect the approach of
torpedo boats, it may be used by the boats themselves to prevent the
attacked vessel from discerning them.</p>

<p>In turret ships, electric lights may be so arranged that the instant
an object is brought into the field of the beam of light, the turret
guns will be bearing on it.</p>

<p>One great disadvantage of electric lights is the impossibility of
protecting them from the enemy's fire, and this is a defect that cannot
be eradicated, though it may be lessened, by manipulating them from
the tops of a ship.</p>

<p><i>Torpedo Guns.</i>&mdash;Hitherto by torpedo guns has been meant small
guns mounted on carriages so constructed that a shot may be fired
into the water only a few feet from the ship's side, or mitrailleuses,
Gatlings, &amp;c. Here the term is applied only to machine guns, which
are constructed to fire either volleys, or, extremely rapidly, single
shot, each shot of which would be capable of <i>penetrating</i> and <i>sinking</i>
torpedo boats, such as Messrs. Yarrow and Thornycroft are daily
launching from their yards. Of such weapons there are at present
only two, viz., the "Nordenfelt" and "Hotchkiss" gun. The former
has, after very exhaustive experiments, been adopted by the English,
Austrian, Swedish, and other naval authorities, while the latter has
been adopted by the French government.</p>

<p><i>Nordenfelt Torpedo Gun.</i>&mdash;This gun, as it at present is constructed,
consists of four barrels of 1 inch calibre.</p>

<p>The barrels are fixed in a horizontal plane, and are not moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
during the firing; and the movement of the lever, the loading, the
firing, and the extracting are all performed in the same plane, so that
the <i>elevation</i> of the gun is not disturbed by the firing.</p>

<p>The gun is fed by means of hoppers, each of which contains ten
rounds per barrel, <i>i. e.</i>, forty shots.</p>

<p>The continuous supply of cartridges, as well as the firing and
extracting, are all performed by one motion of the lever, thus enabling
the gunner to use his left hand to lay the gun.</p>

<p>A volley of four shots can be fired at the same moment, or one shot
can be fired separately. Eight shots can be fired in 1-1/4 seconds; twenty,
thirty, or forty shots can be fired at a rapidity of two hundred shots
per minute without difficulty.</p>

<p>The recoil being taken up by the whole framework of the gun
does not in the least disturb the aim.</p>

<p>The entire mechanism of the gun can be opened up without undoing
a single screw, in less than 20 seconds.</p>

<p>All the four spiral firing springs can be taken out, without opening
the rest of the mechanism, in 1-1/2 seconds.</p>

<p>All the parts of the mechanism are made interchangeable, so that
reserved parts can at any time be substituted. The gun can be placed
on half cock, so that the strikers do not act; and for further security
the lever can be locked. The carrier block, without which the gun
cannot be fired, is loose, and can be taken away, in case it becomes
necessary to abandon a gun, which is thus made useless to the
enemy.</p>

<p>The bullets are solid steel, weighing about 1/2 lb. At 1760 yards at
right angles this gun will penetrate a 3/16 inch steel plate, which
represents the thickness of the plates of a torpedo boat.</p>

<p>At 200 yards at right angles it will penetrate one 3/16 inch steel
plate placed in front of a 1/2 inch steel plate with a space of 3 feet
between them, this target representing the plates and boiler of a
torpedo boat.</p>

<p>At the same distance, at 30° angle against the line of fire, it will
penetrate a 1/2", 1/4", or 3/16" steel plate.</p>

<p>The holes in some instances are from 6 to 11 inches in length, and
2-1/2 inches in height. Angle of depression 20°, of elevation 30°, and of
direction 360°.</p>

<p>Weight of the gun 3-3/4 cwt., and weight of carriage 2-1/2 cwt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hotchkiss Torpedo Gun.</i>&mdash;This gun consists of a group of five
barrels, revolving on a central shaft, a breech block, containing the
firing mechanism, a feeding hopper, and the necessary hand crank for
training and firing. The gun is mounted on trunnions attached to a
vertical column, which rests in a suitable socket bolted to the ship's
side; by this means a universal motion is obtained.</p>

<p>The essential difference between this and the Nordenfelt gun is,
that the <i>barrels</i> and mechanism are put into rotatory motion.</p>

<p>Another point of difference is that single shots only can be fired,
and not a volley, as in the Nordenfelt gun.</p>

<p>With the Hotchkiss gun, only some thirty shots can be fired in one
minute at an advancing torpedo boat. The weight of the Hotchkiss
steel shot is about 1 lb., but owing to the low velocity of the gun, its
penetrative power is little more than that of the Nordenfelt 1/2 lb.
bullet.</p>

<p>The object to be gained in firing at an attacking torpedo boat is to
sink her, and not merely to kill or disable her crew, for supposing the
attack to be made with a contact spar torpedo, and the boat to have
reached within 300 yards' distance from the ship, then, even if all the
crew (probably two or three men) were disabled or killed, the boat
would, if not sunk, still carry out its work of destruction; therefore
the projectiles to be used under such circumstances should be only
those capable of penetrating a torpedo boat's plates, <i>i. e.</i>, solid steel
shot, not shells.</p>

<p><i>Diving.</i>&mdash;In laying down and in picking up submarine mines,
divers will be found extremely useful; also in clearing a passage in a
river, &amp;c., of an enemy's torpedoes in time of war. During the late
Turco-Russian war, the harbour of Soukoum Kaleh taken by the
Turks was <i>popularly</i> supposed to have been cleared of its mines by
native divers (Lazees), but as the torpedoes so captured were never
seen at Stamboul, it must have been a stretch of imagination; probably
such would have been done, had there been any mines in the harbour
to clear away.</p>

<p>The following is a general description of Messrs. Siebe and Gorman's
improved diving apparatus.</p>

<p>The apparatus consists of</p>

<ul>
<li>1. An air-pump.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>2. The diving dress.</li>
<li>3. The breast-plate.</li>
<li>4. The helmet.</li>
<li>5. The boots.</li>
<li>6. The crinoline.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Air-pump.</i>&mdash;This improved air-pump consists of two double action
cylinders, each cylinder capable of supplying about 135 cubic inches
per revolution. The advantage of this air-pump is, that it can supply
air to two divers, working independently and at different levels, each
diver being in direct connection with one of the cylinders. The air-pipes
are in lengths of 45 feet and 30 feet, made of vulcanised india-rubber
with a galvanised iron wire imbedded; this protects from
corrosion, and allows the air to pass through the pipes with less
friction.</p>

<p><i>Diving Dress.</i>&mdash;The diving dress is made of solid sheet india-rubber,
covered on both sides with tanned twill; it has a double
collar, the inner one to pull up round the neck, and the outer one of
vulcanised india-rubber to go over the breast-plate and form a water-tight
joint. The cuffs are also of vulcanised india-rubber, and fit
tightly round the wrist, making, when secured by the vulcanised
india-rubber rings, a water-tight joint, at the same time leaving the
diver's hand free.</p>

<p><i>Breast-plate.</i>&mdash;The breast-plate is made of tinned copper, and has
a valve in front, by which the diver can regulate the pressure of air
inside his dress and helmet. The outer edge of the breast-plate is of
brass, and is secured by screws to the outer collar of the dress.</p>

<p><i>Helmet.</i>&mdash;The helmet is made of tinned copper, and has a segment
bayonet screw at the neck, corresponding to that of the breast-plate,
which enables the helmet to be removed from the breast-plate by one-eighth
of a turn. It has three strong plate glasses in brass frames,
protected by guards; two oval at sides, and a round one on the front;
the front one can be unscrewed, to enable the diver to give and take
orders. At the side is an outlet valve, which, by inserting a finger,
the diver can close, and so rise to the surface. The valve allows the
foul air to escape, and prevents the entrance of the water. An elbow
tube is securely fitted on the helmet, to which is fixed an inlet
valve, to which the air-pipe is attached. The inlet valve is made
that the air can enter, but in case of a break in the air-pipe it cannot
escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>The front and back weights are of lead, heart-shaped, and weigh
about 40 lbs. each.</p>

<p><i>Boots.</i>&mdash;The boots are made of stout leather, with leaden soles, and
are secured over the instep by a couple of buckles and straps. Each
boot should weigh at least 20 lbs.</p>

<p><i>Crinoline.</i>&mdash;The crinoline or shackle is used for deep water; it is
placed round the body and tied in the front of the stomach: being
supported by braces, it affords protection to the stomach, and enables
the diver to breathe more freely.</p>

<p><i>Ladder.</i>&mdash;An iron ladder should be provided with stays to bear
against the side of the boat from which the diving is carried on, to
which may be attached (if working in deep water) an ordinary rope
ladder, with ash rounds, and weighted at the end. Some divers have
the ladder only 20 feet long, to the last round a rope with a weight
attached, which rests on the ground; by that means they descend.</p>

<p><i>Directions for using the Apparatus.</i>&mdash;The ladder having been fixed,
the position of the pump should be decided on, and it should be
securely lashed by means of the ropes attached to the handles down
to a stage, into which the <i>screw-eyes</i> should be fastened if necessary;
the pump should be placed out of the way of the divers, the men
attending on them, and all the men employed. The best position
for the pump is facing the head of the ladder, and about six feet
from it.</p>

<p>While the diver is dressing, the pump should be prepared for use,
the winch handles should be taken out of the pump case, the nipples
protecting the crank axles removed, the nuts being replaced on their
screws. The nuts for the ends of the crank axles are taken off, the
fly-wheel placed on the shaft, and the winch handles put on, and
secured by the nuts, which are screwed home with the spanner. The
pump is always worked in its case.</p>

<p>The flaps covering the pressure gauges and that at the back of the
pump case should be opened, the screw on the overflowing nozzle of
the cistern removed, and the cistern filled with water; the caps of the
air delivery pipes should be removed, the necessary lengths of air-pipe
should be put together carefully with washers in place, and all the
screws must be worked home by means of the <i>two</i> double-ended
spanners. The air-pipes should be tested by holding the palm of the
hand to the end of the pipe, till the pressure shown on the pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
gauge is considerably above that corresponding to the depth the diver
is to descend.</p>

<p><i>Dressing the Diver&mdash;Crinoline only for Deep Water.</i>&mdash;The diver
having taken off his own clothes, puts on a guernsey, a pair of drawers,
very carefully adjusted outside the guernsey, and securely fastened by
the tape round the waist, to prevent them from slipping down, and
then a pair of inside stockings. If the water be cold, the diver may
put on two or more of each of the above articles. He then puts on
the crinoline and woollen cap, drawing the latter well over his ears;
some divers find relief from putting cotton saturated with oil in
their ears.</p>

<p>The <i>shoulder pad</i> is then put on, and tied under the diver's arms.
He then gets into the diving-dress, which in cold weather should be
slightly warmed, drawing it well up to his waist; he next puts his
arms into the sleeves, an assistant opening the cuffs by means of the
cuff expanders, or by inserting the first and second fingers of both
hands, taking care to keep his fingers straight. The diver, by
pushing, forces his hand through the cuff. He puts on a pair of
outside stockings and a canvas overall to preserve the dress from
injury.</p>

<p>The diver then sits down, and the inner collar of the dress is drawn
well up and tied round the neck with a piece of spun yarn, and the
breast-plate put on, great care being taken that the india-rubber of
the outer collar is not torn in putting it over the projecting screws
of the breast-plate. The four pieces of the breast-plate band, which
with the thumbscrews had been previously placed for safety in one
of the boots, are then put over the outer collar, and secured to the
projecting screws by means of the thumbscrews; the centre screw of
each plate should be tightened first. It will generally be sufficient if
the thumbscrews be screwed up hand-tight, the spanner being only
used when necessary. The canvas overall is now adjusted and the
boots are put on.</p>

<p>The rings are passed over the cuffs, and the sleeves of the overall
are drawn down to cover them. If gloves are to be used, the rings
will be put on over them, as well as the cuffs. The helmet (without
the front bull's-eye) is then put on; before doing so, the attendant
should blow through the outlet valve of the helmet; he can do so by
placing his head in the interior, and placing his mouth to the hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
where the air escapes. Blow strongly; if in proper working order, the
valve will vibrate. A loop of the life line is placed round the diver's
waist, the line brought up in front of the man's body, and secured
with a piece of small rope passing round his neck, or to the stud on
the helmet. The waist-belt is buckled on with the knife on the left
side, the end of the air-pipe being passed from the front, through the
ring on the belt on the man's left, and up to the inlet valve on the
helmet, to which it is secured; the upper part of the pipe is then
made fast by a lashing to the stud on the left of the helmet. The
diver then steps on the ladder, and two men are told off to <i>man
the pump</i>.</p>

<p>The weights are then put on, the front weight first, the clips being
placed over the studs on the breast-plate. The back weights are then
put on, and the clip lashings over the hooks on the helmet, and the
two are secured to the diver's body by means of the lashing from the
back weight, which is passed round the waist, through the thimble
beneath the front weight, and tied to the other end of the lashing at
the back weight.</p>

<p>When the signalman is sure that all is right, and that the diver
understands all the signals, he gives the word <i>Pump</i>, and screws the
centre bull's-eye into the helmet securely; this done, he takes hold
of the life line and "pats" the top of the helmet, which is the signal
for the diver to descend.</p>

<p><i>Signals employed.</i>&mdash;The signalman is the responsible person, and
must be very vigilant all the time the diver is down; occasionally he
will give one pull on the life line, and the diver should return the
signal by one pull signifying "all right;" if the signal be not returned,
the diver must be hauled up, but if the diver wishes to work
without being interrupted by signal, he gives one pull on the line, independently,
for "All right; let me alone." If the signalman feels any
irregular jerks, such as might be occasioned by the diver falling into
a hole, he should signal to know if he is all right, and if he does not
receive any reply, he should haul him up immediately. If the diver
from any cause is unable to ascend the ladder, and wishes to be pulled
up, he gives four sharp pulls on the life line. If while being hauled
up the diver gives one pull, it signifies "All right; don't haul me any
more." The diver should be hauled up slowly and steadily. If the
signalman wishes the diver to come to the surface, he gives four sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
pulls on the line, on which the diver should answer "All right," return
to the foot of the ladder, and signal to be hauled up.</p>

<p><i>One</i> pull on the air-pipe signifies that the diver wants more air.
<i>Two</i> pulls on the life line and <i>two</i> pulls on the air-pipe in rapid
succession, signify that the diver is foul and cannot release himself,
and requires the help of another diver; on receiving such a signal, no
attempt should be made to haul the diver to the surface.</p>

<p>The above signals are to be invariably used; but other signals
may be arranged as is most convenient for any particular work, as a
great variety can be made with the life line and air-pipe. The diver
can communicate with the surface by means of a slate.</p>

foregoing diving apparatus, will be found in Messrs. Siebe and Gorman's

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<small>ELECTRICITY.</small></h2>


<div class="drop-cap"><i>THEORY of Electricity.</i>&mdash;The theory most readily understood,
and which most satisfactorily explains the various electrical
phenomena, is as follows:&mdash;</div>

<p>"That every substance and every atom of the world is pervaded
by a peculiar, subtle, imponderable fluid which is termed <i>Electricity</i>,
but which is not known to exist, or remains in a state of <i>electrical
equilibrium</i>, until evoked by certain causes."</p>

<p>The effect of causing a disturbance of this equilibrium is to increase
the normal, or natural, electricity in some particles, and to equally
decrease it in other particles, i.e. what one loses the other gains.
An excess of natural electricity is denoted by the term <i>positive</i>, or
mathematical symbol (+) while a deficiency is denoted by the term
<i>negative</i>, or symbol (-).</p>

<p><i>Like electricities repel each other.</i></p>

<p>That is to say, two bodies charged with an excess of, or positive,
electricity, being brought together repel each other, neither wishing to
increase the excess that has been evoked in them.</p>

<p>Similarly in the case of two bodies charged with a deficiency of, or
negative, electricity, neither wish to add to the deficiency already
there.</p>

<p>In both these cases there can be no tendency to electrical equilibrium,
which is the principle at work. In the former case, there
being already too much, more will but increase the disturbance.</p>

<p>In the latter case, further deficiency will but add to the irregularity.</p>

<p><i>Unlike electricities attract each other.</i></p>

<p>That is to say, if two bodies, one charged with positive, or
having an excess of electricity, the other charged with negative, or
having a deficiency of electricity, be brought together, they will attract
each other; both being desirous of altering their existing state, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
one by decreasing its excess, and the other by decreasing its deficiency
of electricity.</p>

<p>In this case, there will be a tendency to equilibrium, caused by
attraction. The earth is supposed to be a vast reservoir of electricity,
from which a quantity can be drawn to fill up a deficiency, and which
is always ready to receive an excess from other bodies. Every body in
nature has its own natural quantity of electricity, and when an object
is negatively electrified, or has a deficiency in its normal quantity,
there is a tendency to receive a supply from any convenient source.
Such an object would receive electricity from the earth if means were
afforded; and a body <i>positively</i> electrified, would tend to part with its
excess in the same manner. Where such facilities for establishing
electrical equilibrium are afforded, the result is the passage of a
<i>current</i> of electricity.</p>

<p><i>Conductors.</i>&mdash;Sensible effects can be produced by electricity at
great distances from the source, provided there be a medium of
communication, that is, good <i>conductors</i> to transfer it. When a glass
rod is rubbed with a piece of silk, it becomes charged with an excess
of, or positive, electricity, and at the same time the silk becomes
charged with negative electricity.</p>

<p>The glass rod will retain the positive electricity upon it for some
time, unless touched with the wet hand, a wet cloth, a metal, &amp;c., when
it will instantly cease to be electrified. The electricity is then said to
have been conducted away, and the bodies which allow it to run off the
glass are called <i>conductors</i> of electricity. Metals, water, the human
body, charcoal, damp wood, and many other bodies are conductors.</p>

<p>Those bodies which conduct electricity hardly at all, such as the
air, silk, glass, sealing wax, gutta percha, india rubber, &amp;c., are termed
<i>nonconductors</i> or <i>insulators</i>.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, all substances <i>conduct</i> electricity in some degree,
and a <i>nonconductor</i> is merely a <i>bad</i> conductor.</p>

<p>In the following table the bodies are arranged in their order of
conductivity, i.e. each substance conducts better than that which
precedes it; the first-named body is the best insulator, and the last-named
one is the best conductor.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dry air.</li>
<li>Ebonite.</li>
<li>Paraffin.</li>
<li>Shellac.</li>
<li>India rubber.</li>
<li>Gutta percha.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></li>
<li>Resin.</li>
<li>Sulphur.</li>
<li>Sealing wax.</li>
<li>Glass.</li>
<li>Silk.</li>
<li>Wool.</li>
<li>Dry paper.</li>
<li>Porcelain.</li>
<li>Dry wood.</li>
<li>Stone.</li>
<li>Pure water.</li>
<li>Rarefied air.</li>
<li>Sea water.</li>
<li>Saline solutions.</li>
<li>Acids.</li>
<li>Charcoal, or Coke.</li>
<li>Mercury.</li>
<li>Lead.</li>
<li>Tin.</li>
<li>Iron.</li>
<li>Platinum.</li>
<li>Zinc.</li>
<li>Gold.</li>
<li>Copper.</li>
<li>Silver.</li>
</ul>

<p>Though two substances are near one another in the above list, they
do not necessarily approach one another in their power of conducting.
For instance, taking the conducting power of pure silver as represented
by the number 100, then</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="conducting power of metals">
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left">Pure&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left">Copper will be equal to 99·9,</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left">&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left">Gold&nbsp; will be equal to 78·0,</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">while&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left">Zinc&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left">will be only equal to 29·0,</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<div class='unindent'>and pure water, which is half-way down the list, will offer 6,754
millions more resistance than silver to the passage of the electric
current.</div>

<p>The metals being the best known conductors, are usually employed
as the means of transferring the electric current from one place to
another.</p>

<p><i>Electric Circuit.</i>&mdash;The conditions attending this operation are
different from those of any other known method of transmission.</p>

<p>A complete <i>circuit</i> must always be formed by the electric current,
i.e. it cannot start from one place <i>A</i>, travel to another place <i>B</i>, and
cease there, but the current must be completed before it can be said to
have reached <i>B</i>. There cannot be a current of electricity without a
means of recombination, which recombination must be at the <i>source</i>, or
place of original disturbance.</p>

<p>This "place of disturbance" or <i>source</i> must be considered as having
two sides, i.e. at some spot the normal or natural electrical equilibrium
is disturbed, and electricity is separated into too much (positive) on
one side, and too little (negative) on the other side. If then no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
of recombination be afforded, the electricities remain separated, and no
current exists; but if a <i>conductor</i> be made to connect the two sides,
electricity is set in motion, and a current established. Originally to
form a circuit between two stations <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, a conducting wire and a
return wire were necessary, but in 1837 Steinway discovered that the
earth itself answered all the purposes of a return wire, in fact under
favourable conditions much better. Thus, to form a circuit between <i>A</i>
and <i>B</i>, a conducting wire is required, and a buried metal plate at <i>A</i> and
<i>B</i>, the earth by these means taking the place of the return wire.</p>

<p>The aforesaid metal plates are technically termed <i>earth plates</i>.
The greater the size of the earth plates (up to certain limits), the
deeper they are buried, and the better the conducting power of the soil
surrounding them, the better conductors the plates become, or the less
resistance the earth portion of the circuit offers. If either plate be
not in communication with the earth, or else be separated from the
wire, the circuit is not complete, or, as it is termed, "it is broken," and
no current will flow, the signal not made, torpedo not fired, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>"Short" Circuit.</i>&mdash;Due to the fact that recombination, or a tendency
to equilibrium, is always at work when electricity has been
evoked, the conducting path along which the electric current flows
must be covered with a nonconducting substance, or, as it termed,
"insulated," or else the current would not perform its duty, but escape
to earth, and so form what is termed a "short circuit."</p>

<p>A current of electricity always chooses the <i>easiest path</i> to effect
recombination, or electrical equilibrium.</p>

<p><i>Insulators, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;On land, telegraph wires are as a rule laid above
the ground, and therefore require supporting at every few yards; this
is done by means of posts, and as these are formed of substances which
are conductors of electricity, the wires require to be insulated from
them. The insulators generally employed for such purposes are cup-shaped
pieces of porcelain, or pottery, fixed to the head of the telegraph
posts. By means of these insulators, the current of electricity is
prevented from escaping to the earth by the post conductors.</p>

<p>A certain amount of leakage, or loss of electricity, must occur at
each of these posts, as there is no such thing as a perfect insulator.
When the wires are laid on the ground or under ground, or under
water, they are insulated by covering them with gutta percha, india
rubber, &amp;c., and any loss of current is thus prevented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Methods of generating Electricity.</i>&mdash;For the purposes of torpedo warfare
there are two methods of evoking electricity, viz.&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1.&mdash;By <i>chemical action</i>.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2.&mdash;By <i>friction</i>.</div>

<p><i>By Chemical Action.</i>&mdash;<i>Chemical action</i> is the chief source of free electricity,
the representative of which is the galvanic, or Voltaic, battery.</p>

<p>The electricity so generated is also termed dynamical electricity,
due to there being a constant electric current, so long as the poles of
the battery producing it are kept closed; the electricity being thus in
a <i>dynamic</i> or moving state.</p>

<p>By chemical action is signified that which occurs when two or
more substances so act upon one another as to produce a third
substance differing altogether from the original ones in its properties,
or when one substance is brought under such conditions that it forms
two or more bodies differing from the original ones in their properties.</p>

<p><i>Definition and Properties of a Voltaic Cell.</i>&mdash;The <i>Voltaic</i> cell consists
of an insulating jar, containing a liquid, in which are placed two plates
or pieces of dissimilar metals; the liquid must be composed of two or
more chemical elements, one of which at least tends to combine with
one or other of the metals, or <i>with both in different degrees</i>.</p>

<p>By a Voltaic <i>battery</i> is meant a number of cells above one; this
term, however, is often applied to a single cell when working by itself.</p>

<p>A "<i>simple</i> Voltaic cell," "element," or "couple," consists of two
metals placed in a conducting liquid. If two metals&mdash;for instance,
zinc and copper&mdash;are placed in water slightly acidulated, without
touching each other, no effect is apparent; but if they be made to touch,
bubbles of hydrogen gas are formed over the copper plate, and continue
forming these until the plates are separated. After being in contact
for some time, the copper plate will be found unaltered in weight, but
the zinc plate will have lost weight, and the portion so lost will be
found in the liquid in the form of sulphate of zinc. The same effects
are also produced by connecting the two plates by means of some
conducting substance, instead of placing them in contact.</p>

<p>Zinc is invariably employed as one of the metal plates, on account
of the ease with which it dissolves in dilute acids; and the greatest
results are obtained when the second metal plate is not acted upon at
all by the liquid, for then the whole effect due to the oxidation of the
zinc plate is obtained; but when the second plate is also chemically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
acted upon, then only the effect due to the difference between the two
chemical actions is obtained, for, as will be explained further on, they
each act in directly opposite directions.</p>

<p><i>Voltaic Current.</i>&mdash;The Voltaic current makes its appearance under
the general laws of electrical action.</p>

<p>When a body charged with an <i>excess</i> of, or <i>positive</i>, electricity, is
connected with the earth, electricity is transferred <i>from</i> the charged
body to the earth; and similarly when a body is charged with a
<i>deficiency</i> of, or <i>negative</i>, electricity, is connected with the earth,
electricity is transferred <i>from</i> the earth to the body.</p>

<p>Generally whenever two conductors in different electrical conditions
are put in contact, electricity will flow from one to the other. That
which determines the direction of the transfer is the relative <i>potential</i>
of the two conductors. Electricity always flows from a body at <i>higher
potential</i> to one at <i>lower potential</i>, when the two are in contact, or connected
by a conductor. When no transfer of electricity takes place
under these conditions, the bodies are said to be at the <i>same potential</i>,
which may be either <i>high</i> or <i>low</i>. The <i>potential</i> of the earth is assumed
to be <i>zero</i>.</p>

<p><i>Definition of Potential.</i>&mdash;"The <i>potential of a body or point, is the
difference between the potential of the body or point, and the potential of
the earth</i>."</p>

<p>Difference of potential for electricity is analogous to difference of
level for water. Now, since, when a metal is placed in a vessel containing
a liquid, electricity is produced, the liquid becomes of a different
potential to the metal, each being electrified in an opposite way; and
therefore, as above stated, there being a <i>difference</i> of potentials, electricity
will tend to flow from one to the other.</p>

<p>This is evidence of a <i>force</i> being in action, for there can be no motion
without some force to produce it.</p>

<p><i>Electro-motive Force.</i>&mdash;<i>Electro-motive force</i> is the name given to a
peculiar force to which is due the property of producing a difference
of potentials. When it is said that zinc and water produce a definite
electro-motive force, what is meant is, that by their contact a certain
definite difference of potentials is produced.</p>

<p>The <i>electro-motive force</i> of a Voltaic element may be termed its
<i>working</i> power, in the same way as the pressure of steam is the working
power of a steam engine, though this is not to be considered as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
real source of power, which, as will be seen, is uncertain. Due to the
difference of potential of the metal and the liquid, a current of
electricity will flow from one to the other, causing the chemical
decomposition of the liquid, and the reaction may be taken as the
origin of the power employed.</p>

<p>But while the expenditure of energy (which is necessary to produce
a <i>force</i>) is accounted for by taking the chemical action as the source of
power, the preceding cause of this chemical action, viz. the flowing of
the current of electricity due to the difference of potential of the metal
and the liquid, must also have first involved the expenditure of energy;
thus the real source of power is very uncertain.</p>

<p><i>Electrolytes.</i>&mdash;As before stated, a Voltaic cell consists of two plates
of dissimilar metals, which must be immersed in a liquid composed of
two or more chemical elements, one of which at least will combine with
one or other of the metals, or both in a different degree. Those liquids
which are thus decomposed by the passage of a current of electricity
are termed <i>electrolytes</i>.</p>

<p>The elements, then, forming the electrolyte may have chemical
affinity for both metals, though in a greater degree for one than the other.</p>

<p>"Oxygen" is the most important element of an electrolyte, and to the
<i>affinity for oxygen of the metals</i> is the magnitude of the result and effect.</p>

<p><i>Terms Electro-positive and Electro-negative.</i>&mdash;All metals have a definite
relation to each other as to the potential which any one may have when
brought into contact with another. Thus, when zinc is brought into
contact with copper, the former has a potential positive to the latter,
i.e. a current of electricity will tend to flow from the zinc to the
copper. The metals may be so placed in a list that each one would be
positive to any of those that follow it; it is then said to be electro-positive
to them, and they are electro-negative to it. As those metals
which are electro-positive to others have a greater affinity for oxygen,
and those that are electro-negative to others a less affinity for this
element, the terms electro-positive and electro-negative signify, in
effect, greater or less affinity for this element. Conversely, oxygen
will combine more readily with the former than with the latter.</p>

<p>The following list shows the commoner metals arranged in electro-chemical
order.</p>

<p>Take the case of a Voltaic cell composed of zinc and copper plates
immersed in water.</p>

<p>The passage of electricity through the water will decompose it
into its elements hydrogen and oxygen, the latter having an affinity
for both the plates, but considerably more so for the zinc plate.</p>

<p>Then, an electro-motive force will be generated at each metal, and
these forces will act in opposition to each other, but the greater
strength of the one will overcome the weaker, and the real power of
the electric current will be the difference between the two.</p>

<p><i>Definition of "Elements."</i>&mdash;The battery plates are termed the positive
and negative <i>elements</i>. A Voltaic battery has two <i>poles</i>&mdash;a positive and
a negative&mdash;which are the terminations of the plates.</p>

<p><i>Direction of Current.</i>&mdash;The course of the current in a Voltaic cell
is as follows:&mdash;<i>Within</i> it leaves the electro-positive plate (or element),
and flows to the electro-negative plate, but <i>outside</i> the cell (or as it
were on its return path) it flows from the positive <i>pole</i> to the negative
<i>pole</i>. The current always leaves the battery by the positive <i>pole</i>, and
thus the copper is the negative <i>element</i>, but the positive <i>pole</i>, because
the current leaves the battery by it; and the zinc is the positive
element because the current begins there, <i>within</i> the cell, and the
negative <i>pole</i> because it ends there, <i>outside</i>.</p>

<p>The positive pole is the terminal of the negative plate, and <i>vice
versâ</i>. There is but one current from a battery, viz. a positive one;
what is called a negative current is merely the positive current
passing in the reverse direction from the same pole, that is, the
positive pole.</p>

<p><i>Single and Double Fluid Batteries.</i>&mdash;Galvanic batteries may be
divided into single fluid and double fluid batteries. The simplest
form of galvanic cell practically in use is a single fluid cell, consisting
of a zinc and a copper element, immersed in water slightly acidulated
by the addition of a little sulphuric acid. In a battery of several
cells, the zinc and copper plates are generally soldered together in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
pairs, and placed in a long stoneware or glass trough, divided into
separate cells by means of partitions. By filling the cells with
sand, this battery is made more portable, the plates being thus
supported, and the liquid prevented from splashing about during
transit.</p>

<p>In this form it is called the <i>common sand battery</i>.</p>

<p><i>Action in a Single Fluid Cell.</i>&mdash;The following process goes on in
the single fluid cell when the circuit is closed&mdash;that is, when the
battery is set to work.</p>

<p>The water (composed of hydrogen and oxygen) is decomposed by
the passage of the electric current, and oxide of zinc is formed. The
oxygen of the water having greater affinity for the zinc, leaves the
hydrogen. The zinc during the process is being consumed, as coal is
consumed when it burns, while combining with the oxygen of the air.
This oxide of zinc combines with the sulphuric acid, and forms sulphate
of zinc; this salt is found to accumulate in solution in the liquid of
the cell. At the same time the hydrogen of the water goes to the
negative or copper plate, and gathers over it in bubbles.</p>

<p>The process will be better seen by the accompanying plan of the
chemical decomposition and recombinations.</p>

<p>No <i>single fluid</i> cell can give a constant electro-motive force because
of the <i>polarisation</i> of the plates.</p>

<p><i>Definition of the term Polarisation.</i>&mdash;The word <i>polarisation</i> means
that the plates become coated with the products of the decomposition
of the <i>electrolyte</i>, producing a diminution of current. In the above
described battery, the hydrogen gathers on the surface of the copper
plate, and an <i>electro-motive force</i> is set up which counteracts the
electro-motive force producing the current&mdash;the copper plate is said
to be <i>polarised</i>. By the bubbles of hydrogen collecting on the face of
the negative plate, the <i>surface</i> in contact with the liquid is gradually
decreased; thus the plate becomes practically smaller, and a single
fluid cell which at starting gave a good current soon shows that it
is really weakened. The consequence is that the zinc is consumed
extravagantly as well as the acid, and the cell working with poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
results. Also the <i>resistance</i> of the cell is increased, due to the
sulphuric acid, which is added to the water to increase its conductivity,
being gradually used up, by combining with the oxide (see plan) and
forming sulphate of zinc. Liquids are very bad conductors of
electricity; the greater part of the ordinary internal resistance of a
battery arises from this cause. The common sand battery is the worst
of all batteries as regards constancy of electro-motive force, the
<i>polarisation</i> being greater in this battery than any other because the
gas cannot readily escape. The common copper and zinc cell is the
next in order of demerit. The <i>Smee</i> single fluid cell, in which the
negative plate is a platinum instead of a copper one, is better than
the copper zinc cell, because the free hydrogen does not stick to the
rough surface of the platinum plate so much as to the copper.</p>

<p><i>Double Fluid Batteries.</i>&mdash;All the defects of the single fluid battery,
which are as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1. Diminution of electro-motive force,</div>

<div class='hang2'>2. Inconstancy,</div>

<div class='hang2'>3. Increase of internal resistance,</div>

<div class='unindent'>are remedied in the <i>double fluid</i> battery, of which the <i>Daniell's cell</i> was
the first invented, and is a good example. Of this kind of cell many
forms are in use, but the principle is the same throughout. There is
a positive and negative element, and the cell is divided into two
receptacles for the two fluids. In the most constant form of Daniell
cell, the zinc is plunged into a semi-saturated solution of sulphate of
zinc, the copper in a saturated solution of sulphate of copper, and
these two solutions are separated either by a porous barrier, or by
taking advantage of the different specific gravities of the two solutions.
By a <i>saturated</i> solution is meant a liquid which has dissolved as
much of the substance as it possibly can.</div>

<p><i>The Chemical Action of a Daniell Cell.</i>&mdash;The chemical action of
this form of Daniell cell is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The zinc electrode combines with oxygen; the oxide thus formed
combines with sulphuric acid and forms sulphate of zinc. Oxide of
copper is separate from the sulphate; and the copper in this oxide is
separated from the oxygen. The oxygen of the water is separated at
the zinc electrode from the hydrogen, and at the other electrode this
hydrogen recombines with the oxygen from the oxide of copper. This
alternate decomposition and recombination of the elements of water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
can neither increase nor decrease the E.M.F. of the cell, the
actions being equal and opposite. The result of the series of actions
above described is that the sulphuric acid and oxygen of the sulphate
of zinc are transmitted to the zinc, combine with it, and form fresh
sulphate of zinc; the sulphuric acid and oxygen of the sulphate of
copper are transmitted to the zinc set free by the above process, and
reconvert it into sulphate of zinc; the copper of the sulphate of copper
is transmitted to the copper electrode, and remains adhering to it.
The whole result is therefore the substitution of a certain quantity of
sulphate of zinc for an equivalent quantity of sulphate of copper,
together with a deposition of copper on the copper or negative
electrode.<a name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> The following is a plan of the process:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Description of the "Callaud" and "Marié-Davy" Batteries.</i>&mdash;The
Voltaic batteries in general use for the different purposes of torpedo
warfare have been fully described in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV</a>., and therefore it will
be only necessary here to explain the construction of the "Callaud"
and "Marié-Davy" batteries, these being much used abroad in connection
with telegraphy.</p>

<p>The <i>Callaud</i> cell, named from the inventor, is a modification of the
Daniell cell, and is also called a <i>gravity</i> battery, the liquids being
simply prevented from mixing by the law of gravity forbidding the
heavier of the two from rising through the lighter. It consists of a
thin plate of copper, which is laid on the bottom of a good <i>insulating</i>
jar having an <i>insulated</i> wire leading up the side, and on this plate are
placed crystals of sulphate of copper. A solution of sulphate of zinc
is then poured in, and on the top is fitted a zinc plate, which forms
the positive element. The vessel must not be shaken, or the sulphate
of copper when dissolving will mix with the solution above it.</p>

<p>The <i>Marié-Davy</i> cell consists of a carbon electrode in a paste of
proto-sulphate of mercury and water contained in a porous pot, and a
zinc electrode in dilute sulphuric acid, or in sulphate of zinc.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>
<p><i>The Circuit.</i>&mdash;In connection with the manipulation of batteries,
there is one important item to consider, viz. the <i>resistance</i> in the <i>circuit</i>,
which may be divided into <i>external</i> and <i>internal</i>.</p>

<p><i>Resistances.</i>&mdash;The <i>external</i> resistance in practice is that which exists
in the conducting line, and the various instruments connected with it.</p>

<p>The <i>internal</i> resistance is that which exists in the battery itself.
All known conductors oppose a sensible <i>resistance</i> to the passage of
an electric current, and the strength of the current, or in other
words, the quantity of electricity passing per second from one point
to another, when a constant difference of potentials is maintained
between them, depends on the <i>resistance</i> of the wire on the conductor
joining them. A bad conductor does not let the electricity pass so
rapidly as a good conductor, that is, it offers more <i>resistance</i>.</p>

<p>Resistance in a wire of constant section and material is <i>directly</i>
proportional to the <i>length</i>, and <i>inversely</i> proportional to the <i>area of the
cross section</i>.</p>

<p>The electrical resistance of a conductor must not be considered as
analogous to mechanical resistance, such as the friction which water
experiences in passing through a pipe, for this frictional resistance <i>is
not</i> constant when different quantities of water are being forced through
the pipe, whereas electrical resistance is constant whatever quantity of
electricity be forced through the conductor.</p>

<p><i>Application of Ohm's Law.</i>&mdash;<i>Ohm's law</i>, which governs the strength
of the current, is expressed by the equation</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="equation">
<tr><td align="left" rowspan='2'>C =&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><span class='u'>E</span></td>

</table></div>

<ul>
<li>Where C is the strength of the current;</li>
<li>E is the E.M.F. or difference of potentials;</li>
<li>and R is the resistance of the circuit.</li>
</ul>

<p>In words, <i>Ohm's law</i> means that the strength of the current is
<i>directly</i> proportional to the E.M.F., and <i>inversely</i> proportional to the
resistance of the circuit.</p>

<p>As before stated, the resistance of the circuit consists of an
<i>external</i> and an <i>internal</i> resistance, therefore when these resistances
are separately considered, the equation C = E / R must be converted into
C = E / (<i>x</i> + <i>r</i>), where <i>x</i> is the external, and <i>r</i> the internal, resistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>The resistance of the battery or the <i>internal resistance</i> depends on
the size of the plates and the distance between them, that is, it is
<i>directly</i> proportional to the distance, and <i>inversely</i> proportional to
the size.</p>

<p>The <i>electro-motive</i> force of a battery is dependent generally on the
number of cells joined in <i>series</i>, and not on the <i>size</i> of the plates.
The cells of a battery may be joined in two ways, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang2'>1. In series: that is, by connecting the negative element of one
cell to the positive element of another, and so on.</div>

<div class='hang2'>2. In multiple arc: that is, by connecting negative to negative,
and positive to positive; which is the same as increasing
the size of the cells.</div>

<p>If the conductor between the battery poles be such that the
<i>external</i> resistance <i>x</i> may be practically left out, then C = E / <i>r</i>, and no
change in the strength of the current will be effected by adding any
number of cells in series, as <i>r</i> will increase equally with <i>E</i>, and
therefore <i>C</i> will remain the same; but if under the same conditions
the cells be joined in <i>multiple arc</i>, then <i>r</i> will decrease as <i>E</i> increases,
and therefore <i>C</i> will be increased.</p>

<p>Thus with a short circuit of small external resistance, the strength
of the current will be increased by increasing the size of the plates,
or by joining the cells in multiple arc, but not in series.</p>

<p>If the conductor between the poles of the battery be such that the
external resistance <i>x</i> becomes very great, then C = E / (<i>x</i> + <i>r</i>), where <i>x</i> is
very great compared to <i>r</i>. By joining the cells in multiple arc <i>r</i>
is decreased, but <i>E</i> and <i>x</i> remain the same, and therefore <i>C</i> is not
materially altered, as <i>x</i> is very great compared to <i>r</i>. By connecting
the cell in series, <i>r</i> is increased, and so is <i>E</i>, but as <i>r</i> is still very
small compared to <i>x</i>, the strength of the current <i>C</i> is increased.</p>

<p>Thus with a long circuit of great <i>external</i> resistance, the strength
of the current will be increased by joining the cells in series, but not
in multiple arc.</p>

<p>When the external resistance <i>x</i> is neither very large nor very
small in comparison with the battery or internal resistance <i>r</i>, then the
strength of the current <i>C</i> will be increased by adding the cells in
series, and also in multiple arc. By the former process the E.M.F. <i>E</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
is increased more than the resistance of the circuit <i>R</i> or (<i>x</i> + <i>r</i>), and
by the latter process, the E.M.F. <i>E</i> is unaltered, whilst the circuit
resistance (<i>x</i> + <i>r</i>) is decreased. All the above may be practically
demonstrated by the employment of suitable <i>galvanometers</i>.</p>

<p><i>Frictional Electricity.</i>&mdash;<i>Frictional</i> electricity is produced by the
friction of two insulators. There is <i>no difference whatever in kind</i>
between "Voltaic" and "frictional" electricity.</p>

<p><i>Comparison with Voltaic Electricity.</i>&mdash;The electricity generated by
friction possesses a great electro-motive force, producing on even a
small conductor a large charge, whereas the electricity generated by
the galvanic cell possesses a very small electro-motive force, and
produces only a small charge on a small conductor. But when the
conductor is large, the electricity produced by the galvanic cell will
almost instantaneously charge the conductor to the maximum potential
it can produce, the galvanic cell developing an immense quantity of
electricity by the chemical reaction; whereas the quantity developed
by friction between two insulators is so small, that if it be diffused over
a large conductor the potential of the conductor will be very little
increased.</p>

<p>The late Professor Faraday has proved that one cell of a Voltaic
pile possesses the same quantity of electricity as an ordinary sized
frictional machine after being wound round 800,000 times, thus
showing the contrast between the qualities of frictional and Voltaic
electricity.</p>

<p>The electricity of the frictional machine and that of the galvanic
battery may be made to produce the same effect, there being no difference
in kind between them. Frictional electricity can be made to pass
in a current, but it is comparatively feeble. Again, Voltaic electricity
can be made to produce a spark, but under ordinary circumstances it
scarcely amounts to anything.</p>

<p><i>Description of a Frictional Electric Machine.</i>&mdash;A frictional electrical
machine consists of a vulcanite or glass disc or cylinder, which is
made to revolve between cushions or rubbers of leather or silk. By the
friction the (silk) rubbers become negatively, and the glass disc or
cylinder positively, electrified. The revolving disc immediately after
contact with the fixed rubbers passes close by a series of brass points,
which are connected with a <i>condenser</i>. These points collect the positive
electricity of the glass, the rubbers being put to earth. The positive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
electricity which the glass loses is supplied through the rubber; a
stream of negative electricity flows from the rubbers to the earth
during the charging of the conductor or condenser; in other words,
the positive electricity flows from the earth to the rubber, whence it
crosses to the glass disc and so to the condenser.</p>

<p><i>Definition of a "Condenser."</i>&mdash;A <i>condenser</i> is an arrangement for
accumulating a large quantity of electricity on a comparatively small
surface.</p>

<p><i>The "Leyden Jar."</i>&mdash;The <i>Leyden jar</i>, which is the original type of
the condenser, or accumulator, consists of a glass jar coated inside and
out, up to within a few inches of the mouth, with tinfoil pasted on, but
having no connection with each other. The mouth is usually closed
by means of a wooden stopper, through which a brass rod passes, to the
head of which is affixed a brass knob, &amp;c., the rod and knob being
metallically connected with the <i>inner</i> coating by means of a chain.</p>

<p>The "Leyden jar" may be charged either by connecting the <i>outer</i>
coating to earth (the rubbers of the machine being also to earth), and
the <i>inner</i> coating to the conductor of the machine; or else by connecting
the outer coating to the rubbers, and the inner coating to the
conductor, a complete circuit being necessary to charge the jar as
highly as the frictional electrical machine will admit of.</p>

<p>The <i>conductor</i> of the machine being charged, also forms a kind of
Leyden jar, the conductor in this case being the inner coating,
the air, the <i>dielectric</i>, and the nearest surrounding conductors, such as
the walls of the room, &amp;c., being the outer coating.</p>

<p><i>Meaning of "Dielectric."</i>&mdash;By <i>dielectric</i> is meant a non-conducting
medium, which in the case of the "Leyden jar" is the glass.</p>

<p><i>Frictional Electricity very little used for Torpedo Purposes.</i>&mdash;Frictional
electricity is now seldom used in connection with torpedo warfare, as
on account of its very great power, or electro-motive force, a very
perfectly insulated cable must be employed, which is somewhat
difficult to obtain; it is also necessary to employ a condenser, which
requires a certain time to charge. For these and other reasons, frictional
electricity has been abandoned for the far more practical Voltaic
electricity.</p>

<p><i>Magnetism.</i>&mdash;A <i>magnet</i> is a piece of steel, which has the peculiar
property, among others, of attracting iron to its ends.</p>

<p>Certain kinds of iron ore, termed the <i>loadstone</i>, have the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
properties. The word "<i>magnet</i>" is taken from the country Magnesia,
where the loadstone was first discovered.</p>

<p>Magnetism in a body is considered to be a peculiar condition caused
by electrical action. Both electricity and magnetism have the power
of communicating their properties to other bodies without being in
contact with them, i.e. <i>inducing</i> the power, which on the bodies being
placed far apart becomes insensible.</p>

<p><i>The "Poles" of a Magnet.</i>&mdash;Every magnet has two <i>poles</i>, called the
<i>north</i> and <i>south</i> poles. A magnetic steel needle if pivoted on an
upright point, or suspended from its centre, will fix itself, pointing
north and south; in England the end of the needle pointing to the
north is termed the north pole, but in France it is termed the south
pole. The reason of this difference is owing to the fact that the north
pole of one magnet attracts the south pole of another, and therefore, as
the earth is considered as one vast magnet, the end of the magnetic
needle attracted to the north pole of earth magnet should be the south
pole of the magnet; thus the French south pole in a magnet is the
English north pole, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p><i>Permanent Magnets.</i>&mdash;A piece of steel when magnetised is termed a
<i>permanent</i> magnet, because it retains its magnetism for a considerable
length of time; but soft iron cannot be permanently magnetised.</p>

<p>A piece of soft iron rendered magnetic by induction retains a
portion of its magnetism for some time after it has been removed
from the magnetic field, by reason of what is called its <i>coercive force</i>.
This remnant of magnetisation is called <i>residual magnetism</i>.</p>

<p><i>Effect of an Electrical Current on a Magnetic Needle.</i>&mdash;A magnetic
bar or needle pivoted on its centre will point north and south, but if
an electric current is caused to flow along a wire parallel to and either
over or under the magnetic needle, the latter will be turned from its
position, and remain so as long as the current continues; on the current
ceasing the needle will resume its original position.</p>

<p>The magnetic needle can be turned either to the east or the west,
according to the direction and course of the electrical current.</p>

<p>Thus:&mdash;</p>

depend on this principle for their usefulness. These instruments have

<p><i>The Electro-Magnet.</i>&mdash;If a piece of insulated wire be coiled round a
rod of soft iron, and a current of electricity be made to pass through
the coil, the iron core becomes magnetic as long as the current passes;
when the current ceases the magnetism disappears.</p>

<p>During the passage of the electric current, the iron core possesses
all the properties of a magnet. Therefore if a piece of iron were placed
near its poles it would be attracted and released from attraction as
often as the current passed or ceased; and supposing such a piece of
iron to be retained by a spring, &amp;c., a series of movements, attraction,
and drawing back would be effected.</p>

<p>A piece of iron so arranged is termed an <i>armature</i>, and the instrument
is called an <i>electro-magnet</i>.</p>

<p>The coil of wire must be carefully insulated, or else the electric
current will pass through the iron core to earth instead of performing
its proper work.</p>

<p>An electro-magnet is much more powerful than a steel magnet of
equal dimensions, and depends on the strength of the current by which
the magnetism is induced, and the number of turns of wire round the
core. The north and south poles of an electro-magnet are determined
by the direction in which the current flows through the wire.</p>

<p>At the <i>south</i> pole the current passes <i>with</i> the hands of a watch, and
at the <i>north</i> pole <i>against</i> the hands of a watch.</p>

<p><i>Definition of the "Ohm."</i>&mdash;The "ohm" is the standard used for electrical
resistance; it is obtained by observing what effect is produced
by a current of electricity on a certain conductor in a certain time.</p>

<p>The ohm is a small coil of German silver wire representing the
resistance overcome by a current in a certain time.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>


<p><i>McEvoy's Single Main System.</i>&mdash;Hitherto in connection with a system of
electrical submarine mines, it has been necessary to employ either a single
cable between each submarine mine and the torpedo station, or a single
cable, termed a "multiple cable," containing a limited number of insulated
wires, leading from the station, and branching off from a junction box to
each mine, by which considerable cost and complication is incurred. To
remedy the above serious defects of such a system, and also to simplify
the arrangement of electrical tests, Captain McEvoy has devised and
patented the following apparatus; at the firing, or torpedo station, the
end of the single main cable, that is, the single core cable leading to the
junction box, is connected to a make and break contact apparatus, by which,
by the movement of a dial or pointer around a fixed centre, a battery can
be successively put in connection with the wire, and disconnected from it,
in a somewhat similar manner to Wheatstone's step by step dial telegraphs.
In the junction box at the opposite end of the single core main cable is an
electro-magnetic apparatus for working a dial or pointer in exact unison
with the aforesaid dial or pointer at the torpedo station. This junction
box dial or pointer serves as a contact maker to put the wire of the main
cable successively in contact with the branch wires leading to the several
torpedoes, as it is caused to turn with a step by step motion by the sending
of a succession of currents from the firing station.</p>

<p>As the contact maker completes the circuit between the main cable and
one of the branch wires, the current passes from the cable through the
wire, and through the fuze of that particular torpedo to "earth"; but
when any one or other of the torpedoes is to be exploded, the circuit
between the main cable and the torpedo wire being completed, it is only
necessary to send a current through the main cable of sufficient strength to
ignite the fuze, and so explode the mine.</p>

<p>The strength of the current used for giving the aforesaid step by step
motion to the junction box dial or pointer is not sufficient to cause the
ignition of the fuzes in the torpedoes.</p>

<p>Again, if it be desired that the torpedoes should be so arranged that
when any of them are struck by a passing vessel, the fact of its having
been struck should be instantly signalled to the firing station. The dial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
apparatus in the junction box is arranged so that at one point of its
revolution, termed the "zero point," all the torpedo branch wires are in
circuit with the main cable, and that then a constant current is passing
from the firing station through all the circuit closers, and out through
resistance coils to "earth." In this case, if one of the circuit closers be
struck, and therefore short circuit formed, the current passes direct to earth
without going through the aforesaid resistance, and the fact of its having
done so is at once indicated by a galvanometer at the firing point, by the
movement of which a bell is rung at the station. The operator can then
explode such torpedo at once by merely switching in the firing battery.</p>

<p>At the same time the passage of the strong firing current may fuze a
connection in the junction apparatus, by which the exploded torpedo is
detached, i.e. the direct "earth" connection of such a torpedo is cut off, and
the remaining submarine mines are left in proper working order; this
effect may also be arrived at by other means.</p>

<p><i>General Description of Apparatus.</i>&mdash;The following is a general description
of this exceedingly clever and useful invention:&mdash;</p>

<p>At <a href="#Fig_168">Fig. 168</a> is shown a diagram view of the apparatus.</p>

<p><i>A</i> is the instrument at the firing point on the shore or vessel; <i>B</i> is the
cable wire led to a submerged box situated near the spot where the several
torpedoes are grouped; <i>C</i> is the instrument enclosed in the submerged box;
<i>D</i>, <i>D</i> are insulated wires led away from the box to the several torpedoes,
there being a separate wire for each torpedo.</p>

<p>Each of the wires <i>D</i> is coupled to one or other of a series of metallic contact
pieces <i>E</i> ranged in a circle round the axis of a metallic pointer <i>F</i>, which can
be turned with a step by step motion and successively brought into electrical
contact with the several contact pieces <i>E</i>. The axis of the pointer is in
electrical communication with the wire of the cable. The wire from the
cable is first led to the coils of an electro magnet <i>G</i>, and thence passes to the
axis of the pointer. <i>H</i> is a magnetic armature in front of the electro magnet
<i>G</i>; when a positive current of sufficient strength is sent through the cable
the armature is rocked in one direction, and when a negative current is
sent, it is rocked in the opposite direction. From the armature motion is
transmitted to a pawl which works into the teeth of a ratchet wheel on the
axis of the pointer <i>F</i>, so that by sending a succession of reversed currents of
sufficient strength through the cable, the pointer <i>F</i> is turned with a step by
step motion and is successively brought into electrical contact with the
several contact pieces <i>E</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a id="Fig_168"></a>
<div class="caption">M<sup>c.</sup>EVOY'S SINGLE MAIN SYSTEM</div>
<img src="images/i_408.jpg" width="500" height="789" alt="Plate LIV" /><a id="Plate_LIV"></a>
</div>

<p>In the instrument, at the firing point <i>a</i> is a handle, by the turning of
which a step by step motion is given to the pointer of a dial <i>b</i> and a simultaneous
movement to the pointer <i>F</i> of the instrument <i>C</i> in the submerged
box. When the handle <i>a</i> has made a half turn it couples one pole of the
battery to the cable and the other to the earth connection, and when it has
made a complete turn the connections are reversed. The pointer of the dial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
<i>b</i> then moves forward from one division of the dial to the next, and simultaneously
the pointer <i>F</i> is turned in unison with it. The operator at the
firing point can therefore always see which of the torpedoes is in electrical
connection with the wire of the cable, and he can test each torpedo in
succession by moving a handle, say at <i>h</i>, to cause the current passing back
from the torpedo to pass through a galvanometer at <i>e</i>, and by the movement
of the needle of the galvanometer it can be seen whether the resistance of
the circuit through this torpedo is in its normal and proper working state.</p>

<p>When the pointer of the dial <i>b</i> is brought to zero, or as it is marked
in the drawing to "signal," then the pointer <i>F</i> of the apparatus <i>C</i> is in
electrical communication with a contact point which is coupled to all of the
branch wires <i>D</i>, and usually the apparatus is left in this condition, the
handle <i>a</i> being then locked and prevented from turning by a bolt actuated
by a handle at <i>G</i>.</p>

<p>The current from the battery at the firing point then passes to earth
through the resistances in all of the torpedoes. If now any one or other of
the torpedoes is struck by a passing vessel and the wire from its fuze put
directly to earth, so that the current passes freely to earth instead of having
first to pass through the resistance, the fact of the current passing freely to
earth is notified at the firing point by the movement of the needle of a galvanometer
<i>d</i>; the movement of the needle of this galvanometer effects an
electrical connection by which a small battery is caused to sound a bell at <i>c</i>.
The operator at the firing point can then if he pleases at once fire the
torpedo that has been struck by moving a handle at <i>f</i> and coupling up to the
wire of the cable a battery of greater strength; the strong firing current will
pass to earth through the fuze of the torpedo that has been struck, and will
ignite this fuze, but will not affect the fuzes of the other torpedoes, as to pass
through these fuzes it has also to pass through resistances which impede its
passage and reduce its strength, so that the portion of the current which
passes to earth through them is not of sufficient strength to ignite the fuzes.</p>

<p>When the fuze of any one or other of the torpedoes is exploded by the
passing of a strong firing current through it, the wire leading from the box
<i>C</i> to this torpedo is simultaneously cut off from electrical connection with
the contact pin <i>E</i> to which it was previously connected, and this pin is put
to earth through a resistance either somewhat greater or less than the
resistances in the torpedoes, so that the firing of one or more of the torpedoes
does not interfere with the power of being able to turn the pointer
<i>F</i> of the apparatus <i>C</i> in unison with the pointer of the dial <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>Afterwards the operator at the firing point can ascertain which of the
torpedoes has been fired by passing the pointer of the dial <i>b</i> to each of the
divisions of the dial in succession, and ascertaining by the galvanometer a
the resistance of the circuit through each of the torpedoes, so that he at
once ascertains which torpedo has been put to earth through the greater or
less resistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>The cutting off of the wire <i>D</i> from its contact <i>E</i> when a strong current
is passed through it may be effected by the wire being coiled around an iron
core forming an electro magnet, which when a strong current is passed
through the wire is of sufficient strength to shift the position of a contact
apparatus and then effect the required alterations in the connections, but
which is not of sufficient strength to effect any change when the weaker
currents used for the signalling and testing operations are passed through
the wire.</p>

<p>It will be evident that with the above described apparatus any one or
other of the torpedoes can if desired be exploded by the operator at the
firing point whenever he desires to do so. To effect this he would by
turning the handle <i>a</i> bring the pointer of the dial <i>b</i> opposite to the division
of this dial; that would indicate that the cable had been brought into
electrical communication with the torpedo required to be exploded, and then
when it is ascertained by previously adjusted sight points that the vessel is
above the torpedo, he can fire the torpedo by passing a strong firing current
to the cable.</p>

<p>In this way the apparatus can be used for firing any one or other of a
group of sunken torpedoes, or if the torpedoes are buoyant ones, they need
not be fitted with apparatus for putting the wire from their fuze directly
to earth whenever the torpedo is struck by a passing vessel. The same
arrangement of apparatus can also be used for firing any one or other of a
number of mines or torpedoes on land and for separately testing the firing
mechanism of each mine whenever desired.</p>

<p>Captain McEvoy's single main system will shortly undergo a series of
experiments under the supervision of the English torpedo authorities at
Chatham, which will most probably result in its adoption by the English
government, and also by the principal continental powers.</p>

<p>"The volume is prettily got up, and the views of Arctic scenery are about

<p>"Thanks to English pluck and perseverance, combined, in so many
instances, with the ability to write a book, we have become as familiar with
Arctic-life scenes and adventures as they can be made so by description. In
the present well-got-up little volume, we have an account of the first voyage
of the <i>Pandora</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We can heartily recommend Lieut. Innis-Lillingston's
narrative&mdash;his first attempt, as he tells us, at book-writing&mdash;as giving a graphic
account, in a very unpretentious style, of his most interesting, but perilous
cruise.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As a gilt book, we can also recommend the <i>Land of the
White Bear</i>, for it is exceedingly well illustrated, and both in letter-press and
binding is in the Messrs. Griffin's usually good style."&mdash;<i>U.S. Gazette.</i></p></blockquote>
